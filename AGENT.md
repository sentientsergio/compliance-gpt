# Agent Guide

Use this file to rehydrate context between sessions and keep lightweight notes as the project evolves.

## Quick start
- Read `README.md` for repo orientation and links to background.
- Read `docs/roadmap.md` for the current plan, phased milestones, and POC scope.
- Background prompts and prior model responses live in `context/` (files `1_...` through `5_...`).
- Sample PDFs for experiments live in `sample_docs/source/` (Relius) and `sample_docs/target/` (Ascensus).

## Working notes
- Add brief session notes here (date + what changed/decided) to keep future runs aligned.

## Phase rhythm and checkpoints
- At the start of each phase, define success criteria and tests (what evidence will count as “done”).
- During the phase, log findings, decisions, and deviations from plan.
- Before moving forward, review evidence against the criteria and record a short “phase exit” note.
- Capture per-phase learnings for the whitepaper (what worked, what broke, what we’d change).
