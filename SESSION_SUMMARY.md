# Session Summary
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30
**Session:** Extraction Pipeline Completion + Fragmentation Architecture Consultation

---

## Today's Achievements

### 1. Full Extraction Pipeline Complete ✅

All 4 documents successfully extracted:

**BPD Extractions (v4.1 with Extraction Gate):**
- **Relius BPD:** 565 provisions from 98/100 pages (98.0% success)
- **Ascensus BPD:** 466 provisions from 81/81 pages (100% success)

**AA Extractions (v5.1 with Atomic Field Rule):**
- **Relius AA:** 1,216 provisions from 43/45 pages (95.6% success)
- **Ascensus AA:** 2,654 provisions from 99/104 pages (95.2% success)

**Total:**
- **4,901 provisions extracted** across 328 pages
- **96.4% overall success rate** (321/333 successful pages)
- **Processing time:** ~11-14 minutes per document

### 2. Critical Discovery: Fragmentation Pattern

**User Insight:** All 5 failed pages (9, 20, 42, 82, 90) in Ascensus AA start mid-hierarchy - provisions whose parents are on the previous page.

**Pattern:**
- Pages starting with H3/H4 depth provisions (indented children)
- LLM cannot see parent section from previous page (parallel processing)
- Results in: schema violations (missing `form_elements`) or truncated responses (token limit)

**Impact:** This is not random LLM failure - it's a **systematic architecture problem** with page-by-page extraction of hierarchical documents.

### 3. Architecture Consultation Requested

Created comprehensive consultation document:
- **[docs/AA_V5.1_FRAGMENTATION_CONSULTATION_2025-10-30.md](docs/AA_V5.1_FRAGMENTATION_CONSULTATION_2025-10-30.md)**

**5 Solution Options Presented:**
1. Accept fragmentation, fix in post-processing (DEFERRED)
2. Multi-page context window (2x cost/time)
3. Context header strategy (hybrid)
4. Two-pass extraction with selective overlap (RECOMMENDED)
5. JSON schema relaxation (allow uncertainty)

**Consultant Response Received:**
- Recommended **hybrid approach**: Option 4 + Option 5 + layout hints
- Industry best practice: Two-stage (fast sweep + targeted repair)
- Schema with explicit uncertainty (`status`, `evidence`, `confidence`)
- Deterministic global reconciliation (not LLM-driven)
- Selective overlap for only ~10-20% fragment pages

### 4. Key Architectural Insights

**What Teams That Ship Do:**
1. **Two-stage architecture** - cheap layout pass + targeted context where ambiguous
2. **Schema with uncertainty** - admit uncertainty explicitly, never by omission
3. **Deterministic global reconciliation** - rule-based tree repair from section numbers
4. **Confidence audit trail** - track status/evidence for downstream QA
5. **Selective overlap** - only pay for context where needed

**Meta-Lesson:** Stop trying to make LLM perfect. Make the SYSTEM reliable.

## Decision Point: v5.2 Architecture

**Current Status:** Awaiting user decision on recommended architecture

**Recommended Approach (from consultant):**
- **AA v5.2 schema** with nested parent_section/local_ordinal objects
- `status: "confirmed"|"estimated"|"unknown"`
- `evidence: "prefix"|"indent"|"context_header"|"none"`
- `confidence: 0.0-1.0`
- Fragment detection flags: `fragment_start`, `indent_depth_hint`, `first_section_prefix`

**Pipeline:**
- **Pass A:** Fast parallel page-by-page (all pages, admit uncertainty)
- **Fragment Detection:** Deterministic (indent delta, section depth, heading absence, LLM hint)
- **Pass B:** Selective re-extract (~10-20% pages) with context header from page N-1
- **Post-Processing:** Global repair (parent inference, ordinal assignment, confidence upgrade)

**Open Questions:**
1. Keep nested schema through pipeline, or flatten after repair?
2. Context header: separate fields or visual separator?
3. Validation: test on 5 pages first, or full implementation?
4. JSON Schema Structured Outputs: add now or defer?

**Expected Outcomes:**
- ≥98% page success rate (from 95.2%)
- No schema violations (explicit uncertainty instead)
- ~13 minutes processing (from 11 minutes, 1.2x cost not 2x)
- Auditable confidence trails for compliance

## Next Session Plan

### Phase 1: Validate Core Concept (Immediate)
1. Draft v5.2 schema with nested parent_section/local_ordinal
2. Patch AA v5.1 prompt with 4 consultant clauses
3. Manually test on 5 failing pages with hand-crafted context headers
4. Verify: no schema violations, correct parent inference

### Phase 2: Build Fragment Detection (Day 2)
1. Implement deterministic fragment detector (indent, section depth, heading)
2. Test on full Ascensus AA (which pages get flagged?)
3. Validate accuracy

### Phase 3: Automate Pass B (Day 2-3)
1. Build context header extractor
2. Implement selective re-extract pipeline
3. Run full Ascensus AA with Pass A + Pass B
4. Compare v5.1 (95.2%) vs v5.2 (target ≥98%)

### Phase 4: Global Repair (Day 3)
1. Implement post-processing defragmenter
2. Parent inference with drop-last-tier + walk-up
3. Ordinal assignment by reading order
4. Flatten schema for downstream

**Estimated timeline:** 2-3 days for full implementation + validation

## Key Learnings

### 1. Fragmentation is Systematic, Not Random
All extraction failures share a common pattern: starting mid-hierarchy. This is not an LLM quality issue, it's an information availability issue.

### 2. Rigid Schema Causes Failures
Forcing `parent_section` to be required when the answer isn't on the page leads to:
- Hallucination (wrong parent)
- Omission (schema violation)
- Truncation (LLM burns tokens explaining uncertainty)

### 3. Production Systems Use Two-Stage + Uncertainty
Industry best practice is NOT perfect first-pass extraction. It's:
- Fast sweep with explicit uncertainty
- Deterministic detection of ambiguity
- Selective targeted repair
- Rule-based global reconciliation

### 4. Cost Control Through Selectivity
Don't double cost for all pages (Option 2). Identify the ~10-20% that need context and only pay for those.

### 5. Audit Trails Are Requirements, Not Overhead
For compliance software, `status`/`evidence`/`confidence` fields enable:
- Downstream QA filtering (`status="estimated"` → manual review)
- Regulatory audit defense ("how was parent determined?" → `evidence="prefix"`)
- Threshold-based processing (`confidence ≥ 0.9` only)
