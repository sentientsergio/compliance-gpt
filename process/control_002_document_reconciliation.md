# Control 002 — Document Reconciliation

**Purpose**  
Ensure the employer’s existing qualified plan terms are accurately carried into the new Cycle 3 document/template.

**Control Objective**  
Detect and resolve variances between source plan docs and target template to preserve qualification.

**Scope**  
All conversions/restatements involving provider change or Cycle update.

**Trigger Event**
Receipt of the intake package (source BPD + source AA, target BPD + target AA or target BPD template, Opinion Letters).

**Owner / Performer**  
Owner: Plan Document Compliance / QA  
Performer: Compliance Analyst

**Key Activities**
1) Intake validation (completeness, last restatement date)
2) **Document merger** (BPD + AA → complete provisions with actual elections)
3) Provision mapping (Eligibility, Compensation, Contributions, Vesting, Distributions, Loans, Hardship, etc.)
4) Variance identification (missing elections, defaults, regulatory shifts)
5) Variance classification (Administrative / Design / Regulatory)
6) Impact analysis (qualification, operational, disclosure)
7) Resolution & approval (amendment or sponsor-approved change)
8) Evidence retention (workbook, memo, sign-offs)

**Note:** BPDs are templates that reference "as elected in the Adoption Agreement" for actual plan terms. Document reconciliation requires merging BPD framework with AA elections to produce complete, comparable provisions.

**Artifacts / Evidence**
- Plan Comparison Workbook (side-by-side merged provisions: [Source BPD + AA] vs [Target BPD + AA])
- **Mapping Analysis CSV** (provision mappings, variance classifications, election recommendations)
- **Executive Summary Report** (natural language summary for sponsor review)
- Exception Log
- Compliance Review Memo
- Legal/QA approvals

**Acceptance Criteria**
- All provisions mapped; deviations corrected or formally approved  
- Sign-offs obtained prior to adoption

**Frequency**  
Per conversion/restatement

**Regulatory References**  
IRC §401(a); Rev. Proc. 2017-41; ERISA §402; DOL Reg. §2520.104b-1

**Effect Type**  
Preventive / Detective
