# GPT-5 Pro Validation Results

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Validator:** OpenAI GPT-5 Pro (with actual PDF documents)
**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Invalidates previous POC approach, defines new architecture

---

## Executive Summary

**TL;DR:** Our entire POC was based on a false premise. We thought we were comparing standalone BPD vs template BPD. In reality, **BOTH are templates** that defer to Adoption Agreements, and **our LLM hallucinated the specific values** from prompt examples.

**The Real Problem:**
- We're not comparing BPD ‚Üí BPD
- We're automating **plan conversion**, which means writing a **target Adoption Agreement**
- This requires **AA ‚Üí AA mapping** (Mode A) or **BPD inference ‚Üí AA** (Mode B)

---

## Critical Findings

### 1. Both BPDs Are Templates (Not Standalone)

**What we thought:**
- Source BPD (Doc 1) = Standalone with specific values ("age 21 and one Year of Service")
- Target BPD (Doc 2) = Template with AA references ("as elected in the Adoption Agreement")

**What GPT-5 proved:**
- Source BPD (Doc 1) = Ascensus **BPD 01** template, Section 2.01 says "**specified in the Adoption Agreement**"
- Target BPD (Doc 2) = Ascensus **BPD 05** template, Article 3.1 says "**as elected in the Adoption Agreement**"
- **BOTH defer to AAs for actual values**

**Evidence from actual PDF:**
```
Page 25, Section 2.01 (Source BPD):
"Each Employee... will be eligible to participate in this Plan upon satisfying
the age and eligibility service requirements SPECIFIED IN THE ADOPTION AGREEMENT."
```

We extracted: "age 21 and completing one Year of Service"
Actual text: "specified in the Adoption Agreement"

### 2. Our LLM Hallucinated Values from Prompt Examples

**The smoking gun:**

Our prompt ([prompts/provision_extraction_v2.txt](prompts/provision_extraction_v2.txt:14)) contained:
```
Examples:
‚úì "An Employee shall be eligible to participate upon attaining age 21 and
   completing one Year of Service."
```

And the JSON example (line 63):
```json
"provision_text": "An Employee shall be eligible... age 21 and completing
                   one Year of Service..."
```

**What happened:**
1. LLM read: "upon satisfying the age and eligibility service requirements specified in the Adoption Agreement"
2. LLM pattern-matched to our example
3. LLM **substituted example values** ("age 21 and one Year of Service")
4. LLM returned hallucinated text as if it came from the document

**Verification:** Searched entire source BPD PDF - the phrase "age 21 and completing one Year of Service" **does not appear anywhere**.

### 3. Document Structure: 2 Plan Sets, Not 2 Pairs

**Correct interpretation:**

Our 4 files represent **2 complete plans** (old vs new):

**Source/Old Plan (complete):**
- `pair_a_source_bpd.pdf` - Ascensus BPD 01 (template)
- `pair_b_source_adoption.pdf` - Source Adoption Agreement (elected values)
- **Together:** Complete plan specification

**Target/New Plan (complete):**
- `pair_a_target_bpd.pdf` - Ascensus BPD 05 (template)
- `pair_b_target_adoption_locked.pdf` - Target Adoption Agreement (elected values)
- **Together:** Complete plan specification

**Not 2 independent pairs (A and B), but 2 sets (source and target).**

### 4. The Real Use Case: Writing Target Adoption Agreements

**What plan conversion actually means:**

When a TPA converts a plan from one vendor to another (or updates to new BPD version), they're not comparing BPDs - they're **writing a new Adoption Agreement** that mirrors the old plan's elections under the new BPD structure.

**Two modes of operation:**

**Mode A (preferred): AA ‚Üí AA**
- Read **source Adoption Agreement** for elected values (age, service, vesting schedule, etc.)
- Map to **target Adoption Agreement** elections allowed under target BPD
- Use BPDs as "dictionaries/guardrails" for what's allowed

**Mode B (fallback): BPD inference ‚Üí AA**
- When source AA is missing/lost
- Infer elections from source BPD operational text (if any exist)
- Or from SPD/"plan as operated" evidence
- Map to target AA
- Flag "needs human choice" for ambiguous items

**Our POC was attempting neither mode** - we were comparing template to template.

## Detailed GPT-5 Findings

### Document Identification

**Question:** Same vendor or different vendors?

**Answer:** Same vendor family (**Ascensus**), but different BPD templates:
- Doc 1: "Basic Plan Document 01, #3000 (Rev. 6/2020)"
- Doc 2: "Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan ‚Äì Basic Plan Document 05"

Different article/section numbering systems, but both Ascensus pre-approved library.

### Section-by-Section Mapping Corrections

**Our wrong mappings:**

| Source | Target | Issue |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Section 4.02 (100% vesting) | Section 13.5 (VESTING REQUIREMENTS) | ‚ùå 13.5 is **SIMPLE 401(k) only**, not general vesting |

**Correct mappings:**

| Source (BPD 01) | Target (BPD 05) | Explanation |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 2.01 Eligibility to Participate | 3.1 Conditions of Eligibility + 3.2 Effective Date | Same function, values in AA |
| 2.04 Break in Service/Rehire | 3.5 Rehired Employees and 1-Year Breaks | Same rehire/break logic |
| 2.03 Transfer to Ineligible Class | 3.2(d) + 3.2(e) | Doc 2 splits class changes into subsections |
| 4.01 Determining Vested Portion | 1.87 "Vested" definition + 3.5(f) break rules + AA schedule | BPD 05 distributes vesting across multiple sections |
| 4.02 100% Vesting (always vested) | **1.1(b) Elective Deferral** + **1.1(f) QMAC** + **1.1(g) QNEC** | These define "nonforfeitable when made" |

**Key insight:** Target BPD **distributes** vesting provisions:
- "Always vested" sources ‚Üí Article I account definitions (1.1)
- Break-in-service effects ‚Üí Article III (3.5(f))
- Vesting schedule ‚Üí **Adoption Agreement** (not in BPD text)
- SIMPLE-specific vesting ‚Üí Article XIII (13.5) **only for SIMPLE plans**

### Extraction Validation Issues

**GPT-5 identified our mistakes:**

1. ‚ùå **Used Section 13.5 for general vesting** - This is SIMPLE 401(k) only
   - Should use: 1.1(b), 1.1(f), 1.1(g) for always-vested sources

2. ‚ùå **Attributed specific values to BPD sections** - Values come from AA
   - Doc 1 Section 2.01 doesn't say "age 21" - it says "specified in AA"
   - LLM hallucinated from prompt examples

3. ‚ùå **Compared template text directly** - Missing the elected values
   - Need to extract from AAs first, then merge

### Why We Got 0% Match Rate

**Root causes (per GPT-5):**

1. **Template vs filled-value mismatch**
   - We compared hallucinated values ("age 21") to template text ("as elected in AA")
   - LLM correctly identified these as non-equivalent

2. **Sectioning drift**
   - BPD 01 has "Section Four: Vesting"
   - BPD 05 distributes vesting across Articles I, III, XIII
   - Cosine similarity struggled with reorganization

3. **Wrong target sections**
   - Matched to SIMPLE-only provisions (13.5)
   - Missed distributed provisions (1.1(b), 1.1(f), 1.1(g))

4. **No metadata in embeddings**
   - Only embedded provision_text (no section numbers, titles, types)
   - Lost strong anchors like "Article III ‚Äî Eligibility"

5. **Verifier too strict**
   - Treated "as elected in AA" as substantively different from specific values
   - Should treat as "schema-level match" (same parameterized rule)

## Architectural Implications

### What We Built (Wrong Approach)

```
Extract from Source BPD ‚Üí Extract from Target BPD ‚Üí Compare
         ‚Üì                         ‚Üì
  (hallucinated values)      (template text)
         ‚Üì                         ‚Üì
    "age 21"          vs    "as elected in AA"
         ‚Üì                         ‚Üì
             LLM: "no match" ‚úì (correct assessment)
```

### What We Should Build (Correct Approach)

**Mode A: AA ‚Üí AA (Preferred)**
```
Extract from Source AA ‚Üí Extract from Target AA ‚Üí Map elections
         ‚Üì                         ‚Üì
   Elected values            Available options
   (age: 21)                (age: [18, 21, other])
         ‚Üì                         ‚Üì
             Mapping: "age 21" ‚Üí "age 21" ‚úì
```

**Mode B: BPD ‚Üí AA (Fallback)**
```
Extract from Source BPD ‚Üí Infer elections ‚Üí Map to Target AA
         ‚Üì                      ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
   Template + samples    Best guess values    Available options
   "as specified in AA"   (age 21 inferred)   (age: [18, 21, other])
   + SPD evidence              ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
                         Mapping + human review flags
```

### Required Components

**New capabilities needed:**

1. **Adoption Agreement Parser**
   - Extract elected values from AA checkboxes/fill-ins
   - Handle locked PDFs (vision fallback)
   - Map AA fields to BPD provision types

2. **BPD Topic Crosswalk**
   - Pre-built map: BPD 01 sections ‚Üí BPD 05 sections
   - Topic-based routing (Eligibility, Vesting, Entry, Contributions, etc.)
   - Handle distributed provisions (vesting across Articles I, III, XIII)

3. **Template + Election Merger**
   - Substitute elected values into BPD template provisions
   - Generate "complete" provisions for comparison
   - Handle optional provisions (if elected in AA, include; else skip)

4. **Two-Stage Matching**
   - Stage 1: Route by topic (Eligibility ‚Üí Eligibility)
   - Stage 2: Semantic similarity within topic bucket
   - Prevents cross-topic false matches (eligibility vs vesting)

5. **Schema-Level Equivalence**
   - Recognize "age 21" ‚âà "age as elected in AA" (same parameter)
   - Classify as "schema-equivalent; values differ/pulled from AA"
   - Don't treat as substantive difference

---

## Specific Fixes Required

### 1. Fix Extraction Prompt (URGENT)

**Problem:** Lines 14 and 63 of [prompts/provision_extraction_v2.txt](prompts/provision_extraction_v2.txt) contain examples with specific values that LLM uses as templates.

**Solution:**
```markdown
Examples:
‚úì "An Employee shall be eligible to participate upon satisfying the age and
   service requirements specified in the Adoption Agreement."
‚úì "The vesting schedule shall be as elected in the Adoption Agreement."

NOT:
‚úó "An Employee shall be eligible upon attaining age 21..." (this is AA text, not BPD)
```

**Critical instruction to add:**
```
PRESERVE TEMPLATE LANGUAGE:
- If the provision says "as elected in the Adoption Agreement", preserve that exact phrase
- If the provision says "as specified in the Adoption Agreement", preserve that exact phrase
- DO NOT substitute example values or numbers
- Extract the ACTUAL text from the document, not what you think it should say
```

### 2. Re-Extract from Both BPDs

**Expected results after fix:**

**Source BPD Section 2.01:**
```json
{
  "provision_text": "Each Employee will be eligible to participate upon
                     satisfying the age and eligibility service requirements
                     specified in the Adoption Agreement.",
  "extracted_entities": {
    "ages": [],
    "service_years": [],
    "template_references": ["Adoption Agreement"]
  }
}
```

**Target BPD Section 3.1:**
```json
{
  "provision_text": "An Employee shall be eligible to participate upon
                     satisfying the age and service requirements, if any,
                     as elected in the Adoption Agreement.",
  "extracted_entities": {
    "ages": [],
    "service_years": [],
    "template_references": ["Adoption Agreement"]
  }
}
```

Now these will be recognized as **schema-equivalent**.

### 3. Extract from Adoption Agreements

**Source AA** (`pair_b_source_adoption.pdf`):
- Extract elected values:
  - Eligibility age: ?
  - Eligibility service: ?
  - Vesting schedule: ?
  - Entry dates: ?
  - etc.

**Target AA** (`pair_b_target_adoption_locked.pdf`):
- **Unlock first** (password-protected)
- Extract available options/elections
- Map source elections to target options

### 4. Build BPD Crosswalk

**Structure:**
```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "eligibility",
      "bpd_01_sections": ["2.01", "2.02"],
      "bpd_05_sections": ["3.1", "3.2"],
      "aa_field": "eligibility_requirements"
    },
    {
      "topic": "always_vested_sources",
      "bpd_01_sections": ["4.02"],
      "bpd_05_sections": ["1.1(b)", "1.1(f)", "1.1(g)"],
      "aa_field": null,
      "notes": "Not elected in AA - always true per IRS rules"
    },
    {
      "topic": "vesting_schedule",
      "bpd_01_sections": ["4.01"],
      "bpd_05_sections": ["1.87", "3.5(f)", "AA"],
      "aa_field": "vesting_schedule",
      "notes": "BPD 05 distributes: definitions (1.87), breaks (3.5f), schedule (AA)"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Enhance Embedding Strategy

**GPT-5 recommendations:**

1. **Include metadata in embedding text:**
   ```python
   # Bad (current)
   embedding_text = provision.provision_text

   # Good (recommended)
   embedding_text = f"{provision.section_reference} {provision.section_title}: {provision.provision_text}"
   ```

2. **Add domain labels:**
   ```python
   keywords = ["eligibility", "rehire", "break-in-service", "always vested", "QNEC", "QMAC"]
   embedding_text = f"{section} {title} [{', '.join(keywords)}]: {text}"
   ```

3. **Two-stage matching:**
   - Filter by provision_type first (eligibility ‚Üí eligibility only)
   - Then compute embeddings within type
   - Prevents cross-type false matches

### 6. Update Semantic Mapping Prompt

**Add schema-level equivalence recognition:**

```markdown
TEMPLATE LANGUAGE EQUIVALENCE:

When comparing provisions, recognize these patterns as SCHEMA-EQUIVALENT:

Source: "age 21 and one Year of Service"
Target: "age and service requirements as elected in the Adoption Agreement"
‚Üí Classification: SCHEMA-EQUIVALENT (same parameter, value deferred to AA)
‚Üí Variance: administrative (structural difference, not substantive)
‚Üí Requires: AA verification to confirm elected values match

Source: "0% for years 1-2, 20% year 3, 40% year 4..."
Target: "according to the vesting schedule specified in the Adoption Agreement"
‚Üí Classification: SCHEMA-EQUIVALENT
‚Üí Variance: administrative
‚Üí Requires: AA verification

DO NOT classify template references as substantive differences unless the
Adoption Agreement elections are known to differ.
```

## Market Research Validation

**This finding validates the core pain point:**

From [research/market_research.pdf](research/market_research.pdf):
> "True document-to-document reconciliation remains largely manual. It relies on
> the expertise of compliance professionals to interpret and compare provisions."

**Why it's manual:** Compliance professionals:
1. Know that BPDs are templates
2. Read the Adoption Agreement for actual elections
3. Mentally map "age 21" in source AA ‚Üí "age as elected" in target BPD
4. Verify the target AA elections match source plan intent
5. Handle cross-vendor structural differences (BPD 01 vs BPD 05)

**Our contribution:** Automate steps 3-5.

## Critical Insights from GPT-5

### 1. On SIMPLE 401(k) Trap
> "Doc 2 ¬ß13.5 lives under SIMPLE 401(k) and says salary reduction + matching
> are fully vested in a SIMPLE design ‚Äî a special case, not the general rule."

**Lesson:** Must detect plan type and scope section usage. Don't match general provisions to plan-type-specific provisions.

### 2. On BPD as Dictionary
> "Use the BPDs only as dictionaries/guardrails."

**Lesson:** BPDs define what's *possible*. AAs define what's *actual*. Don't treat BPD text as plan specifications.

### 3. On Distributed Provisions
> "In BPD 05, 'Vesting Requirements' for general plans aren't in a single 'Vesting'
> article; they're distributed (definitions + break rules + AA)."

**Lesson:** Can't rely on section numbering alone. Need topic-based routing that handles provisions split across multiple sections.

### 4. On Two Modes
> "Mode A (preferred): AA ‚Üí AA. Read the source Adoption Agreement for the actual
> elections, then populate the target Adoption Agreement."

**Lesson:** When source AA is available, use it. Only fall back to BPD inference when AA is missing/lost.
