The target provision concerns the reinstatement of forfeited accounts upon reemployment and repayment after a distribution, which is a 'buyback' or restoration rule under ERISA's break-in-service and vesting provisions. These provisions address entirely different plan features: one is about investment rights in employer securities, the other about restoration of previously forfeited benefits.

The target provision, in contrast, addresses distribution restrictions from certain plan accounts, specifying permissible distributable events (e.g., severance, disability, death, age 59 1/2, hardship, plan termination). There is no overlap in subject matter: one governs investment choices and diversification, the other governs when distributions can be made. These provisions do not convey the same rule or requirement and affect different aspects of participant rights and plan operations.",
