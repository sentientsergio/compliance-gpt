The target provision addresses the allocation formula for top-heavy minimum contributions, specifying how employer contributions and forfeitures are allocated to key employees for nondiscrimination purposes. These provisions address entirely different plan features: one is a restriction on life insurance funding, the other is a top-heavy minimum allocation rule.

The target provision, however, focuses on the exclusive benefit rule, the allocation of contract values, and the return of mistaken contributions, without addressing the disposition of life insurance contracts at separation or insurable interest requirements. The provisions serve different purposes and impose different requirements, affecting both plan operations and participant rights."

These provisions address fundamentally different aspects of plan administration (distribution of insurance/annuities vs. investment management authority), and do not represent the same rule or requirement. The difference could affect both participant rights (access to insurance/annuity distributions) and plan operations (who controls investments)."
