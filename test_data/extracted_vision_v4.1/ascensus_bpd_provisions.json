Rollover Contributions \u2013 Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, rollover contributions (including rollovers of Nondeductible Employee Contributions) and earnings thereon may be distributed at any time upon request. If the Adoption Employer specifies in the Adoption Agreement that Rollover contributions may not be distributed at any time, such contributions will be subject to the Plan's provisions governing distributions of either Employer Profit Sharing Contributions (if this Plan is a profit sharing plan) or Employer Money Purchase Pension Contributions (if this Plan is a money purchase pension plan). Elective Transfers \u2013 Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, elective transfer contributions may be distributed at any time upon request subject to the restrictions below and any other restrictions required by either the Code or applicable regulations. If the Adoption Employer elects in the Adoption Agreement that elective transfer contributions may not be distributed at any time, such contributions will be subject to the Plan's provisions governing distributions of either Employer Profit Sharing Contributions (if the Plan is a profit sharing plan) or Employer Money Purchase Pension Contributions (if this Plan is a money purchase pension plan). Non-Elective Transfers \u2013 Each type of contribution (e.g., Elective Deferral, Employer Matching) included in non-elective transfer contributions received by the Plan as a result of a merger, consolidation, spin-off, or other Employer-initiated event will be distributable pursuant to the Plan's provisions governing distributions of the same contribution type, subject to the provisions of Code section 411(d)(6). If one or more contribution type does not exist under the Plan, such contributions will be subject to the Plan's provisions governing distributions of either Employer Profit Sharing Contributions (if the Plan is a profit sharing plan) or Employer Money Purchase Pension Contributions (if this Plan is a money purchase pension plan). Notwithstanding the preceding, if rollover contributions, elective transfer contributions, or non-elective transfers are not distributable at any time because either 1) no distribution options are selected for Employer Profit Sharing Contributions or Employer Profit Sharing Contributions are not allowed in the Adoption Agreement (if the Plan is a profit sharing plan) or 2) no distribution options are selected for Employer Money Purchase Pension Plan Contributions or Employer Money Purchase Pension Plan Contributions are not allowed in the Adoption Agreement (if the Plan is a Money Purchase Pension Plan), then such contributions may be distributed upon 1) the Participant's Termination of Employment, 2) the termination of the Plan, or 3) if the Plan designates an Early Retirement Age, the Participant's Termination of Employment after satisfying any Early Retirement Age. If a Participant separates from service before satisfying the Early Retirement Age requirement, but has satisfied the service requirement, the Participant will be entitled to elect an early retirement benefit upon satisfying such age requirement. To the extent that any optional form of benefit under this Plan permits a distribution before the Employee's retirement, death, Disability, attainment of Normal Retirement Age, or Termination of Employment, or before Plan termination, the optional form of benefit is not available with respect to benefits attributable to assets (including the post-transfer earnings thereon) and liabilities that are transferred (within the meaning of Code section 414(l)) to this Plan from a money purchase pension plan or a target benefit pension plan. In addition, unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, if such transfers consist of Elective Deferrals or amounts treated as Elective Deferrals (including earnings thereon) from a 401(k) plan, the assets transferred will continue to be subject to the distribution restrictions under Code sections 401(k)(2) and 401(k)(10). A Participant may at any time, and upon a request submitted to the Plan Administrator (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL), withdraw an amount from their Individual Account attributable to Nondeductible Employee Contributions (including earnings thereon). In the event the portion of a Participant's Individual Account attributable to Nondeductible Employee Contributions experiences a loss such that the amount remaining in such subaccount is less than the amount of Nondeductible Employee Contributions made by the Participant, the maximum amount which the Participant may withdraw is an amount equal to the remaining portion of the Participant's Individual Account attributable to Nondeductible Employee Contributions. Subject to Plan Section 5.10, Joint and Survivor Annuity Requirements (if applicable), the Participant may withdraw any part of the Deductible Employee Contribution account by delivering an application (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Plan Administrator. Direct Rollovers of Eligible Rollover Distributions \u2013 Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a Recipient's election under this Plan Section 5.01(D)(1)(b), a Recipient may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator, to have any portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution that is equal to at least $500 (or such lesser amount if the Plan Administrator permits in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner) paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Recipient.",

A Participant may change or revoke such Beneficiary designation by completing and delivering the proper form to the Plan Administrator.\n\nIn the event that a Participant wishes to designate a Primary Beneficiary who is not their Spouse, their Spouse must consent (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to such designation, and the Spouse's consent must acknowledge the effect of such designation and be witnessed by a notary public or plan representative. Notwithstanding the effect of such designation, if the Participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Plan Administrator that such consent may not be obtained because there is no Spouse or the Spouse cannot be located, no consent will be required. In addition, if the Spouse is legally separated or the Participant has been abandoned (within the meaning of local law) and the Participant has a court order to such effect, spousal consent is not required unless a Qualified Domestic Relations Order provides otherwise. Any change of Beneficiary will require a new spousal consent to the extent required by the Code or Treasury Regulations.\n\nB. Payment to Beneficiary \u2013 If a Participant dies before the Participant's entire Individual Account has been paid to them, such deceased Participant's Individual Account will be payable to any surviving Beneficiary designated by the Participant, or, if no Beneficiary survives the Participant, to the Participant's Spouse, or, where no Spouse exists, to the Participant's estate. If the Beneficiary is a minor, distribution will be deemed to have been made to such Beneficiary if the portion of the Participant's Individual Account to which the Beneficiary is entitled is paid to the Beneficiary's legal guardian or custodian, or if no such guardian exists, to the Participant's estate. If the Beneficiary is a minor, distribution will be deemed to have been made to such Beneficiary if the portion of the Participant's Individual Account to which the Beneficiary is entitled is paid to the Participant's court-appointed guardian, an attorney-in-fact acting under a valid power of attorney, or any other individual or entity authorized under state law to act on behalf of the Beneficiary. A Beneficiary may disclaim their portion of a Participant's Individual Account by providing the Plan Administrator written notification pursuant to Code section 2518(b).\n\nC. Distribution Request \u2013 When Distributed \u2013 A Beneficiary or a Beneficiary's guardian, if applicable, may request an amount to be distributed from the Participant's remaining balance. If required in writing, such request will be made on a form provided or approved by the Plan Administrator. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, upon a valid request, the Plan Administrator shall direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) to commence distribution as soon as administratively feasible after the request is received.",
