Compensation shall include payments to an individual who does not currently perform services for the Employer by reason of qualified military service (as that term is used in Code \u00a7414(u)(1)) to the extent those payments do not exceed the amounts the individual would have received if the individual had continued to perform services for the Employer rather than entering qualified military service.\n\n(5) Disability pay.

Net earnings are reduced by contributions by the employer to a qualified plan to the extent deductible under \u00a7404 of the Code.

If Compensation is defined to exclude any items of Compensation (other than safe harbor adjustments permitted under the Code \u00a7414(s) Regulations or limiting Compensation to periods of Plan participation), then for purposes of determining the Compensation of a Self-Employed Individual, Earned Income shall be adjusted by multiplying Earned Income by the percentage of total compensation that is included for the eligible Participants who are Nonhighly Compensated Participants. That percentage is determined by calculating the percentage of each eligible Nonhighly Compensated Participant's total Compensation prior to excluding any non-safe harbor adjustments selected in the Adjustments to Compensation Section of the Adoption Agreement that are included in the definition of Compensation and averaging those percentages.",
