The target provision addresses the requirement to provide employees with a comprehensive notice about their rights and obligations under an Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangement (EACA), including timing, content, and delivery requirements. These provisions address entirely different concepts: employer withdrawal versus participant notification under an EACA. There is no substantive overlap in rule, requirement, or operational effect.",

      "reasoning": "The source provision addresses the procedures for an employer's withdrawal from the plan, including possible spin-off or transfer options, focusing on plan-level employer actions and related administrative processes. The target provision, in contrast, details participant-level distribution rules for various contribution types (rollover, transfer, noneditable employee contributions), including timing, restrictions, and regulatory requirements. There is no semantic overlap: the source is about employer withdrawal mechanics, while the target is about participant distribution rights. The difference is substantive and affects both plan operations and participant rights.",
