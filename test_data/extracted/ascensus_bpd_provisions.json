When this definition applies, for purposes of determining an Employee's initial or continued eligibility to participate in the Plan or the Vested interest in the Participant's Individual Account balance derived from Employer Contributions an Employee will receive credit for all Periods of Service. An Employee will also receive credit for any Period of Service of less than 12 consecutive months. Fractional periods of a year will be expressed in terms of months or days.\n\nThe definition of Break in Service in this Elapsed Time definition will replace the definitions of Break in Eligibility Service and Break in Vesting Service found in the Definitions section of the Plan.\n\nBreak in Service is a Period of Severance of at least 12 consecutive months.\n\nIn the case of an individual who is absent from work for maternity or paternity reasons, the 12-consecutive month period beginning on the first anniversary of the first date of such absence will not constitute a Break in Service. For purposes of this Elapsed Time definition, an absence from work for maternity or paternity reasons means an absence 1) by reason of the pregnancy of the individual, 2) by reason of the birth of a child of the individual, 3) by reason of the placement of a child with the individual in connection with the adoption of such child by such individual, or 4) for purposes of caring for such child for a period beginning immediately following such birth or placement.\n\nEach Qualifying Participant will share in Employer Contributions for the Periods of Service beginning on the date the Employee commences participation under the Plan and ending on the first day of a Period of Severance or the date on which such Employee is no longer a member of an eligible class of Employees.\n\nIf the Employer is a member of an affiliated service group (under Code section 414(m)), a controlled group of corporations (under Code section 414(b)), a group of trades or businesses under common control (under Code section 414(o)), or any other entity required to be aggregated with the Employer pursuant to Code section 414(o), service will be credited for any employment for any period of time for any other member of such group. Service will also be credited for any ordinary or routine service time under Code section 414(n) or Code section 414(o) to be considered an Employee of any Employer aggregated under Code sections 414(b), (c), or (m).\n\nB. Changes In Methods of Crediting Service \u2014 The Plan may be amended to change the method of crediting service between the Hours of Service method of determining service and the Elapsed Time method provided each Employee with respect to whom the method of crediting service is changed is afforded the protection described in Treasury Regulation section 1.410(a)-7(g) and other applicable rules promulgated by the IRS.",

      "provision_text": "Each Employee who satisfies the eligibility requirements specified in the Adoption Agreement for either Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals or Roth Elective Deferrals, if applicable, may enroll as a Contributing Participant with respect to the type of Elective Deferral for which they have satisfied the eligibility requirements, on the first Entry Date coinciding with or following the date the Employee satisfies the eligibility requirements, or if applicable, the first Entry Date following the date on which the Employee returns to the eligible class of Employees pursuant to Plan Section 2.03. A Participant who wishes to enroll as a Contributing Participant must deliver (either in writing or in any other form permitted by the IRS and the DOL) a salary reduction agreement (or agreement to make Nondefeasible Employee Contributions) to Plan Administration except as set forth in Plan Section 3.01(E) below. Except for occasional, bona fide administrative considerations as set forth in the Treasury Regulations, contributions made pursuant to such election cannot precede the earlier of the date on which services relating to the contribution are performed, and the date on which the Compensation that is subject to the election would be payable to the Employee in the absence of an election to defer. Any limits on Elective Deferrals designated by the Employer in Adoption Agreement Section Three may be determined either periodically throughout the Plan Year (e.g., each payroll period) or at the end of the Plan Year provided that the determination is made in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. Notwithstanding the dates set forth in Plan Section 3.01(A) as of which a Participant may enroll as a Contributing Participant, the Plan Administrator will have the authority to designate, in a nondiscriminatory manner, additional enrollment dates during the 12-month period beginning on the Effective Date (or the date that Elective Deferrals may commence, if later) in order that an orderly first enrollment might be completed. In addition, if the adopting Employer has indicated in the Adoption Agreement that Participants may make separate deferral elections with respect to bonuses, Participants will be afforded a reasonable period of time before the issuance of such bonuses to elect to defer all, none, or part of them into the Plan. Such an election to defer all or part of a bonus will be independent of any other salary reduction agreement and will not constitute a modification to any pre-existing salary reduction agreement. If a Plan permits both Pre-Tax and Roth Elective Deferrals and the Participant fails to designate whether their Elective Deferrals are Pre-Tax or Roth Elective Deferrals, the Participant will be deemed to have designated the Elective Deferrals as Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals.",

If less than 100 percent of the Participant's Vested Individual Account (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) is payable to the surviving Spouse, then the Individual Account will be adjusted by first reducing the Vested Individual Account by the amount of the security used as repayment of the loan, and then determining the benefit payable to the surviving Spouse. To avoid taxation to the Participant, unless otherwise permitted by law or regulatory guidance, no loan to any Participant or Beneficiary can be made to the extent that such loan, when added to the outstanding balance of all other loans to the Participant, would exceed the lesser of 1) $50,000 reduced by the excess (if any) of the highest outstanding balance of loans during the one year period ending on the day before the loan is made, over the outstanding balance of loans from the Plan on the date the loan is made, or 2) 50 percent of the Present Value of the nonforfeitable Individual Account of the Participant. For the purpose above, all loans from all plans of the Employer and other members of a group of employers described in Code sections 414(a), 414(c), and 414(m) are aggregated. Furthermore, any loan will be amortized in level payments, not less frequently than quarterly, over a period not extending beyond five years from the date of the loan, unless such loan is to acquire a dwelling unit which, within a reasonable time (determined at the time the loan is made), will be used as the principal residence of the Participant. Notwithstanding the preceding, a Participant will suspend their loan repayments under this Plan as permitted under Code section 414(u)(4). An assignment or pledge of any portion of the Participant's interest in the Plan and a loan, pledge, or assignment with respect to any insured contract purchased under the Plan, will be treated as a loan under this paragraph.
