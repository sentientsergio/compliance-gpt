Identify the Employees of the Employer who are not Highly Compensated Employees of such Employer who participate in the Plan and who are not part of the applicable rate group because their allocation rates are too low, and arrange them in order of their allocation rates from the highest to the lowest.\n\nii. Identify the Highly Compensated Employees who participate in the Plan and are in the rate group and arrange them in order of their allocation rates from the highest to the lowest.\n\niii.

Repeat (iii) above with respect to the individual in (i) above who has the next highest equivalent accrual rate, and continue that process with the other individuals described in (i) above in the order of their allocation rates from the highest to the lowest until such rules are satisfied for the rate group. If the allocation rate of a Highly Compensated Employee is lowered under (iii) above or this clause (iv) to the point where it is equal to that of one or more other Highly Compensated Employees in the rate group, then any further reductions in allocations will be apportioned between the former and latter Highly Compensated Employees in a manner that causes their allocation rates to be reduced by the same amount.",

If the Adopting Employer elects in the Adoption Agreement that elective transfer contributions may not be distributed at any time, such contributions will be subject to the Plan's provisions governing distributions of either Employer Profit Sharing Contributions (if this Plan is a profit sharing plan) or Employer Money Purchase Pension Contributions (if this Plan is a money purchase pension plan).\n\n iii.

Payment to Beneficiary \u2013 If a Participant dies before the Participant's entire Individual Account has been paid to them, such deceased Participant's Individual Account will be payable to any surviving Beneficiary designated by the Participant to their spouse, or where no Spouse exists, to the Participant's estate. If the Beneficiary is a minor, distribution will be deemed to have been made to such Beneficiary if the portion of the Participant's Individual Account to which the Beneficiary is entitled is paid to their guardian or, if applicable, to their custodian under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. If a Beneficiary is not a minor but is not legally competent to request or consent to a distribution, distributions will be deemed to have been made to such Beneficiary if the portion of the Participant's Individual Account to which the Beneficiary is entitled is paid to the Participant's court-appointed guardian, an attorney-in-fact acting under a valid power of attorney, or any other individual or entity authorized under state law to act on behalf of the Beneficiary. A Beneficiary may designate a trust as beneficiary.\n\nC. Distribution Request \u2014 When Distributed \u2014 A Beneficiary entitled to a distribution who wishes to receive a distribution must submit a request (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Plan Administrator. If required in writing, such request will be made on a form provided or approved by the Plan Administrator. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, upon a timely request, the Plan Administrator shall direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) to commence distribution as soon as administratively feasible after the request is received.",

Unless otherwise specified, the provisions of this Plan Section 5.05 apply to calendar years beginning after December 31, 2002.\n\n2. All distributions required under this Plan Section 5.05 will be determined and made in accordance with Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9), including the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of Code section 401(a)(9)(G).\n\n3. Limits on Distribution Periods \u2014 As of the first Distribution Calendar Year, distributions to a Participant, if not made in a single sum, may only be made over one of the following periods (or a combination thereof):\n\n   a. the life of the Participant,\n   b. the joint lives of the Participant and a Designated Beneficiary,\n   c. a period certain not extending beyond the Life Expectancy of the Participant, or\n   d. a period certain not extending beyond the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the Participant and a Designated Beneficiary.\n\nB.

If distributions under an annuity purchased from an insurance company irrevocably commence to the Participant's surviving Spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving Spouse under Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(i), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.\n\nExcept as provided in the Adoption Agreement (or in a separate IRS model amendment, if applicable), Participants or Beneficiaries may elect on an individual basis whether the five-year rule or the life expectancy rule in Plan Section 5.05(D) applies to distributions after the death of a Participant who has a Designated Beneficiary.

If neither the Participant nor the Beneficiary makes an election under this Plan Section 5.05(B) or Plan Section 5.05(D) and, if applicable, the election in the Adoption Agreement (or in a separate IRS model amendment, if applicable), distributions will be made in accordance with Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(ii).",

Any changes in the designation will be considered to be a revocation of the designation. However, there mere substitution or addition of another Beneficiary (one not named in the designation) under the designation will not be considered to be a revocation of the designation, provided such substitution or addition does not alter the period over which distributions are to be made under the designation, directly or indirectly (for example, by altering the relevant measuring life).\n\n4.
