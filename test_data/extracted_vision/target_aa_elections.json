The following four parameters must be met to utilize this section: 1. The formula described must satisfy the definitely determinable requirement under Reg. \u00a71.401-1(b)(1)(ii). 2. The groups cannot be designed in such a manner that the only NHCEs participating are those NHCEs with the lowest amounts of compensation and/or the shortest periods of service and who may represent the minimum number of these employees necessary to satisfy coverage under Code \u00a7410(b). 3. The language of the formula must require the employer to notify the trustee in writing of the amount of the employer contribution being given to each group. 4. In the case of self-employed individuals (i.e., sole proprietorships or partnerships), the requirements of Regs. \u00a71.401(k)-(1)(a)(6) continue to apply and the allocation method should not be such that a cash or deferred election is created for a self-employed individual as a result of the application of the allocation method unless such election has been created for all eligible employees & the full 401(k) requirements have been provided. If the formula is non-uniform, it is not a design-based safe harbor for nondiscrimination purposes.) NOTE: Multiple Employer Plan provisions for adopters other than the lead employer must be noted in the Participating Employer's Agreement. Only the lead Employer's provisions may be noted in this Question 30.B.i."
