Qualified Retirement Plan
Defined Contribution Basic Plan Document 01
DEFINITIONS
When used in the Plan with initial capital letters, the following words and phrases will have the meanings sEet forth below unless the context indicates
that other meanings are intended.
ACP TEST SAFE HARBOR MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS
Means Matching Contributions described in Plan Section 3.01(F) or Plan Section 3.03(B).
ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION PERCENTAGE (ACP)
Means the average of the Contribution Percentages of the Eligible Participants in a group of either Highly Compensated Employees or non-Highly
L
Compensated Employees.
ACTUAL DEFERRAL PERCENTAGE (ADP)
Means, for a specified group of Participants (either Highly Compensated Employees or non-Highly Compensated Employees) for a Plan Year, the
average of the ratios (calculated separately for each Participant in such group) of 1) the amount of Employer Contributions actually paid to the Fund
on behalf of such Participant for the Plan Year to 2) the Participant’s Compensation for such Plan Year. For purposes of calculating the ADP, Employer
P
Contributions on behalf of any Participant will include: 1) any Elective Deferrals (other than Catch-up Contributions or Elective Deferrals subsequently
distributed as a permissible withdrawal) made pursuant to the Participant’s salary deferral election or pursuant to automatic Elective Deferral
enrollment, if applicable (including Excess Elective Deferrals of Highly Compensated Employees), but excluding a) Excess Elective Deferrals of
Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees that arise solely from Elective Deferrals made under the Plan or plans of this Employer and
b) Elective Deferrals that are taken into account in the Actual Contribution Percentage test (provided the ADP test is satisfied both before and after
exclusion of these Elective Deferrals); and 2) if elected by the Employer, Qualified Nonelective Contributions and/or Qualified Matching
Contributions. For purposes of computing Actual Deferral Percentages, an Employee who would be a Participant but for the failure to make Elective
Deferrals will be treated as a ParticipMant on whose behalf no Elective Deferrals are made.
ADOPTING EMPLOYER
Means any corporation, sole proprietor, or other entity named in the Adoption Agreement and any successor who by merger, consolidation,
purchase, or otherwise assumes the obligations of the Plan. The Adopting Employer will be a named fiduciary for purposes of ERISA section 402(a).
ADOPTION AGREEMENT
Means the document executed by the Adopting Employer through which it adopts the Plan and thereby agrees to be bound by all terms and
conditions of the Plan.
A
ADP TEST SAFE HARBOR CONTRIBUTIONS
Means any Basic Matching Contributions, Enhanced Matching Contributions, and Safe Harbor Nonelective Contributions under either the Safe
Harbor CODA provisions or the QACA provisions.
ALTERNATE PAYEE
Means any Spouse, former Spouse, child, or other dependent of a Participant who is recognized by a Domestic Relations Order as having a right to
receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under the Plan with respect to such Participant.
S
ANNUAL ADDITIONS
Means the sum of the following amounts credited to a Participant for the Limitation Year:
a. Employer Contributions;
b. Nondeductible Employee Contributions;
c. Forfeitures;
d. amounts allocated to an individual medical account, as defined in Code section 415(l)(2), that is part of a pension or annuity plan maintained by
the Employer, and amounts derived from contributions paid or accrued that are attributable to post-retirement medical benefits, allocated to
the separate account of a key employee (as defined in Code section 419A(d)(3)), under a welfare benefit fund (as defined in Code section
419(e)), maintained by the Employer;
e. amounts allocated under a simplified employee pension plan;
f. Excess Contributions (including amounts recharacterized); and
g. Excess Aggregate Contributions.
ANNUITY STARTING DATE
Means the first day of the first period for which an amount is paid as an annuity or in any other form.
AUTOMATIC CONTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENT (ACA)
Means a Plan whereby certain Employees are automatically enrolled as Contributing Participants as described in Plan Section 3.01(E)(1).

BASIC MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS
Means Matching Contributions made pursuant to the Safe Harbor CODA formula described in Adoption Agreement Section Three, in an amount
equal to (i) 100 percent of the amount of the Employee’s Elective Deferrals that do not exceed three-percent of the Employee’s Compensation for the
Plan Year, plus (ii) 50 percent of the amount of the Employee’s Elective Deferrals that exceed three-percent of the Employee’s Compensation but that
do not exceed five-percent of the Employee’s Compensation, if applicable.
E
BASIC PLAN DOCUMENT
Means this Pre-approved Defined Contribution Basic Plan Document 01.
BENEFICIARY
Means the individual(s) or entity(ies) designated pursuant to Plan Section Five.
BREAK IN ELIGIBILITY SERVICE
Means a 12-consecutive month period that coincides with an Eligibility Computation PeLriod during which an Employee fails to complete more than
500 Hours of Service (or such lesser number of Hours of Service specified in the Adoption Agreement for this purpose) or such Period of Severance
specified in the Elapsed Time definition, if applicable.
BREAK IN VESTING SERVICE
Means a Plan Year (or other vesting computation period described in the definition of Year of Vesting Service) during which an Employee fails to
complete more than 500 Hours of Service (or such lesser numbePr of Hours of Service specified in the Adoption Agreement for this purpose) or such
Period of Severance specified in the Elapsed Time definition, if applicable.
CATCH-UP CONTRIBUTIONS
Means Elective Deferrals made pursuant to Plan Section Three that are in excess of an otherwise applicable Plan limit and that are made by
Participants who are age 50 or older by the end of their taxable year. An otherwise applicable Plan limit is a limit in the Plan that applies to Elective
Deferrals without regard to Catch-up Contributions, such as the limits on Annual Additions, the dollar limitation on Elective Deferrals under Code
section 402(g) (not counting Catch-up Contributions), the limit imposed by the Actual Deferral Percentage (ADP) test under Code section 401(k)(3),
M
or any other allowable limit imposed by the Employer. Catch-up Contributions for a Participant for a taxable year may not exceed (1) the dollar limit
on Catch-up Contributions under Code section 414(v)(2)(B)(i) for the taxable year or (2) when added to other Elective Deferrals, an amount that
would enable the Employer to satisfy other statutory or regulatory requirements (e.g., income tax withholding, FICA and FUTA withholding). The
dollar limit on Catch-up Contributions in Code section 414(v)(2)(B)(i) was $5,500 for taxable years beginning in 2012. The $5,500 limit is adjusted by
the Secretary of the Treasury, in multiples of $500, for cost-of-living increases under Code section 414(v)(2)(C). Different limits apply to Catch-up
Contributions under SIMPLE 401(k) Plans.
CODE
Means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended from time to time.

2. 3401(a) wages – Compensation is defined as wages within the meaning of Code section 3401(a), for the purposes of income tax withholding at
the source but determined without regard to any rules that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the

gross income but for an election under Code sections 125(a), 132(f)(4), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b)). These amounts

by the Employer to a plan of deferred compensation (including a simplified employee pension described in Code section 408(k)
or a simple retirement account described in Code section 408(p), and whether or not qualified) to the extent that the
contributions are not includible in the gross income of the Employee for the taxable year in which contributed. In addition, any

section 415 purposes, regardless of whether such amounts are includible in the gross income of the Employee when distributed.
ii. Amounts realized from the exercise of a nonstatutory option (that is an option other than a statutory option as defined in

Code section 125).
A
v. Other items of remuneration that are similar to any of the items listed in paragraphs (b)(i) through (b)(iv) above.
For any Self-Employed Individual covered under the Plan, Compensation will mean Earned Income.

Employee becomes an eligible Participant on any date after the first day of the applicable Determination Period, Compensation will include only
that Compensation paid to the Employee during the portion of the Determination Period in which they were an eligible Participant, unless
otherwise required by either the Code or ERISA (e.g., full year compensation used in the calculation of the minimum allocation in a Top-Heavy
SPlan). In addition, if an Employee either becomes or ceases to be a member of an ineligible class of Employees, Compensation will include only
that Compensation paid to the Employee during the portion of the Determination Period in which they were an eligible Participant. Except as
otherwise provided in this Plan (e.g., continued coverage of disabled Participants), Compensation received by an Employee during a
Determination Period in which the Employee does not perform services for the Employer will be disregarded.
Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, Compensation will include a) any amount that is contributed by the Employer pursuant to

available in gross income during such Limitation Year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Compensation for a Participant who is
permanently and totally disabled (as defined in Code section 22(e)(3)) is the Compensation such Participant would have received for the
Limitation Year if the Participant had been paid at the rate of Compensation paid immediately before becoming permanently and totally
disabled. Compensation paid or made available during such Limitation Year will include any elective deferral (as defined in Code section
402(g)(3)) and any amount that is contributed or deferred by the Employer at the election of the Employee and that is not includible in the
gross income of the Employee by reason of Code sections 125, 132(f), or 457.
If elected by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement, amounts under Code section 125 include any amounts not available to a Participant in
cash in lieu of group health coverage (deemed Code section 125 compensation). An amount will be treated as an amount under Code section
125 only if the Employer does not request or collect information regarding the Participants’ other health coverage as part of the enrollment
process for the health plan.

Payments made after Severance from Employment will be either included or excluded from Compensation within the meaning of Compensation
as described in Part A of the definition of Compensation in the Plan’s Definition section, depending on the category of such payments. Whether
or not such payment is included or excluded is based on the definition below and the elections made by the Employer in the Adoption
Agreement. Such payments, if included, must meet the following requirements:
1. Payments described in paragraph (2) below will be included in the definition of Compensation (within the meaning of Compensation as
described in Part A of this definition of Compensation). In addition, unless otherwise elected in Ethe Adoption Agreement, payments
described in paragraphs (3) and (4) below will be excluded from the definition of Compensation (within the meaning of Compensation as
described in Part A of this definition of Compensation). Payments described in paragraph (2) and payments described in paragraphs (3) or
(4), if included in the definition of Compensation, must also meet the following requirements:
a. Those amounts are paid by the later of 1) 2½ months after Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan or 2) the
end of the Limitation Year that includes the date of Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan; and
b. Those amounts would have been included in the definition of Compensation if they were paid before the Employee’s Severance from
L
Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan.
2. Regular Pay. An amount is described in this paragraph (2) if
a. The payment is regular compensation for services during the Employee’s regular working hours, or compensation for services outside
the Employee’s regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses, or other similar payments; and
b. The payment would have been paid to the EmploPyee prior to a Severance from Employment if the Employee had continued in
employment with the Employer.
3. Leave Cashouts. An amount is described in this paragraph (3) if
a. The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation, or other leave, but only if the Employee would have been able to use the
leave if employment had continued.
4. Deferred Compensation. An amount is described in this paragraph (4) if
M
a. The payment is an amount received by an Employee pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan, but only if the
payment would have been paid to the Employee at the same time if the Employee had continued in employment with the Employer
and only to the extent that the payment is includible in the Employee’s gross income.
5. Other post-severance payments. Any payment that is not described in paragraph (2), (3), or (4) above is not considered Compensation under
paragraph (1) above if paid after Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan, even if it is paid within the time period
described in paragraph (1) above. Thus, Compensation does not include severance pay, or parachute payments within the meaning of Code
section 280G(b)(2), if they are paid after Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan, and does not include post-
severance payments under a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan unless the payments would have been paid at that time
without regard to the Severance from Employment. Any payments not described above are not considered Compensation if paid after
SevAerance from Employment, even if they are paid within 2½ months following Severance from Employment.
C. Compensation for ADP, ACP, and Code section 401(a)(4) Testing – Compensation for purposes of ADP, ACP, and Code section 401(a)(4) testing
will be W-2 wages unless another definition of Compensation is elected on the Adoption Agreement for allocation and other general purposes or
another definition is required by law or regulation. Notwithstanding the preceding, a Plan Administrator has the option from year to year to use a
different definition of Compensation for testing purposes provided the definition of Compensation satisfies Code section 414(s) and the
corresponding regulations. In addition, for the Plan Year in which an Employee enters the Plan, the Employee’s Compensation that is taken into
account for purposes of ADP, ACP, and Code section 401(a)(4) testing may be limited to the Employee’s Compensation from the Entry Date on
Swhich the Employee became a Participant in the Plan, applicable to the particular type of contribution.
D. Limits On Compensation – The annual Compensation of each Participant taken into account in determining allocations will not exceed
$200,000, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Code section 401(a)(17)(B). Annual Compensation means Compensation
during the Plan Year or such other consecutive 12-month period over which Compensation is otherwise determined under the Plan
(Determination Period). The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for the calendar year applies to annual Compensation for the Determination
Period that begins with or within such calendar year.
If a Determination Period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual Compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable
annual Compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short Determination Period, and the
denominator of which is 12.
If Compensation for any prior Determination Period is taken into account in determining an Employee’s allocations or benefits for the current
Determination Period, the Compensation for such prior Determination Period is subject to the applicable annual Compensation limit in effect
for that prior period.
E. SIMPLE 401(k) Rules – Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, if an Eligible Employer has established a SIMPLE 401(k) plan,
Compensation means, for purposes of the definition of Eligible Employer and for purposes of Plan Sections 3.01(I) and 3.02, the sum of the wages,
tips, and other compensation from the Employer subject to federal income tax withholding (as described in Code section 6051(a)(3)) and the
Employee’s Elective Deferral contributions made under this or any other 401(k) plan, and, if applicable, elective deferrals under a Code section
408(p) SIMPLE IRA plan, a SARSEP plan, a Code section 403(b) annuity contract, and compensation deferred under a Code section 457 plan,
required to be reported by the Employer on Form W-2 (as described in Code section 6051(a)(8)). Compensation also includes amounts paid for
domestic service (as described in Code section 3401(a)(3)). For Self-Employed Individuals, Compensation means net earnings from self-employment
determined under Code section 1402(a) before subtracting any contributions made under this Plan on behalf of the individual. The provisions of the
Plan implementing the limit on Compensation under Code section 401(a)(17) apply to the Compensation in Plan Sections 3.01(I) and 3.02.

F. Safe Harbor CODA Rules – Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, if an Adopting Employer has elected in the Adoption Agreement
to apply the Safe Harbor CODA provisions to this Plan, Compensation means Compensation as defined in this Definitions section of the Plan and, if
applicable, the definition of Compensation for allocation and other general purposes selected in the Adoption Agreement, except, for purposes of
Plan Section 3.03, no dollar limit, other than the limit imposed by Code section 401(a)(17), applies to the Compensation of a non-Highly
Compensated Employee. Specifically, Compensation for ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions follows the definition of Compensation applicable to
Elective Deferrals and Compensation for ACP Test Safe Harbor Contributions follows the definition of Compensation applicable to Matching
E
Contributions provided such definitions are reasonable definitions within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.414(s)-1(d)(2), do not
discriminate in favor of Highly Compensated Employees pursuant to Treasury Regulation section 1.414(s)-1(d)(3), and permit each Participant to
elect sufficient Elective Deferrals to receive the maximum amount of Matching Contributions (determined using the definition of Compensation
described in the preceding sentence) available to the Participant under the Plan.
G. Elective Deferrals – Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, a Participant may only make Elective Deferrals from Compensation
within the meaning of Compensation as described in Part A of this definition of Compensation. Elective Deferrals may not be withheld from pay
that is excluded from Compensation under the Plan for Elective Deferral purposesL.
H. QACA Rules – Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, if an Adopting Employer has elected in the Adoption Agreement to apply
the QACA provisions to the Plan, Compensation means Compensation as defined in the Definitions section of the Plan and, if applicable, the
definition of Compensation for allocation and other general purposes selected in the Adoption Agreement except, for purposes of Plan Section
3.01(F), no dollar limit, other than the limit imposed by Code section 401(a)(17), applies to the Compensation of a non-Highly Compensated
Employee. Specifically, Compensation for QACA ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions follows the definition of Compensation applicable to
Elective Deferrals and Compensation for QACA ACP Test SaPfe Harbor Matching Contributions follows the definition of Compensation applicable
to Matching Contributions provided such definitions are reasonable definitions within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.414(s)-
1(d)(2), do not discriminate in favor of Highly Compensated Employees pursuant to Treasury Regulation section 1.414(s)-1(d)(3), and permit
each Participant to elect to make sufficient Elective Deferrals to receive the maximum amount of Matching Contributions (determined using the
definition of Compensation described in the preceding sentence) available to the Participant under the Plan or any other alternative definition
permitted pursuant to rules promulgated by the IRS.

Payments to individuals who arMe active duty members of the uniformed services, such individuals will be treated as Employees of the Employer
making the Differential Wage Payment and the Differential Wage Payment will be treated as Compensation for purposes of applying the Code.
Accordingly, Differential Wage Payments must be treated as Compensation as described in Part A of this definition of Compensation.
Differential Wage Payments will also be treated as Compensation for contribution, allocation, and other general Plan purposes, unless excluded
from the Plan’s definition of Compensation on the Adoption Agreement. In addition, the Plan will not be treated as failing to meet the
requirements of any provision described in Code section 414(u)(1)(C) by reason of any contribution or benefit that is based on Differential Wage
Payments only if all Employees of the Employer (as determined under Code sections 414(b), (c), (m), and (o)) performing service in the
uniformed services described in Code section 3401(h)(2)(A) are entitled to receive Differential Wage Payments on reasonably equivalent terms
and, if eligible to participate in the Plan, to make contributions based on the payments on reasonably equivalent terms applying the provisions
of Code Asection 410(b)(3), (4), and (5). Such contributions or benefits may be taken into account for purposes of nondiscrimination testing as
long as they do not cause the Plan to fail the nondiscrimination requirements.

either to correct Excess Aggregate Contributions or because the contributions to which they relate are Excess Deferrals, Excess Contributions, Excess
Aggregate Contributions, or Excess Annual Additions that are distributed.
The Employer may elect, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, to use either Qualified Nonelective Contributions or Elective Deferrals, or both,
in the Contribution Percentage Amounts. Elective Deferrals may only be included in the Contribution Percentage Amounts if the Plan passes the ADP
test both before and after the exclusion of such Elective Deferrals.

consecutive months. Fractional periods of a year will be expressed in terms of months or days.
A
The definition of Break in Service in this Elapsed Time definition will replace the definitions of Break in Eligibility Service and Break in Vesting
Service found in the Definitions section of the Plan.
Break in Service is a Period of Severance of at least 12 consecutive months.
In the case of an individual who is absent from work for maternity or paternity reasons, the 12-consecutive month period beginning on the first
anniversary of the first date of such absence will not constitute a Break in Service. For purposes of this Elapsed Time definition, an absence from
work for maternity or paternity reasons means an absence 1) by reason of the pregnancy of the individual, 2) by reason of the birth of a child of
Sthe individual, 3) by reason of the placement of a child with the individual in connection with the adoption of such child by such individual, or

Each Qualifying Participant will share in Employer Contributions for the Periods of Service beginning on the date the Employee commences
participation under the Plan and ending on the first day of a Period of Severance or the date on which such Employee is no longer a member of
an eligible class of Employees.
If the Employer is a member of an affiliated service group (under Code section 414(m)), a controlled group of corporations (under Code section
414(b)), a group of trades or businesses under common control (under Code section 414(c)), or any other entity required to be aggregated with
the Employer pursuant to Code section 414(o), service will be credited for any employment for any period of time for any other member of such
group. Service will also be credited for any individual required under Code section 414(n) or Code section 414(o) to be considered an Employee
of any Employer aggregated under Code sections 414(b), (c), or (m).
B. Changes In Methods of Crediting Service – The Plan may be amended to change the method of crediting service between the Hours of Service
method of determining service and the Elapsed Time method provided each Employee with respect to whom the method of crediting service is
changed is afforded the protection described in Treasury Regulation section 1.410(a)-7(g) and other applicable rules promulgated by the IRS.
ELECTION PERIOD
Means the period that begins on the first day of the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age 35 and ends on the date of the Participant’s death.

ELECTIVE DEFERRALS
Means any Employer Contributions made either as a Pre-Tax Elective Deferral or as a Roth Elective Deferral to the Plan at the election of the Participant or
pursuant to automatic Elective Deferral enrollment, in lieu of cash compensation, and will include contributions made pursuant to a salary reduction
agreement. With respect to any taxable year, a Participant’s Elective Deferrals are the sum of all Employer contributions made on behalf of such
Participant pursuant to an election to defer under any qualified cash or deferred arrangement as described in Code section 401(k), any simplified
employee pension plan cash or deferred arrangement as described in Code section 408(k)(6), any SIMPLE IRAE Plan described in Code section 408(p), any
plan as described under Code section 501(c)(18), or any Employer contributions made on the behalf of a Participant for the purchase of an annuity
contract under Code section 403(b) pursuant to a salary reduction agreement. Elective Deferrals will not include any deferrals properly distributed as
Excess Annual Additions. In addition, Elective Deferrals will not include contributions made to the Plan as Elective Deferrals under an EACA or QACA that
are subsequently distributed from the Plan in accordance with the permissible withdrawal provisions found in Plan Section 5.01(A)(2).
No Participant will be permitted to have Elective Deferrals made under this Plan, or any other qualified plan maintained by the Employer, during any
taxable year of the Participant, in excess of the dollar limitation contained in Code section 402(g) in effect at the beginning of such taxable year.
Elective Deferrals under an EACA or QACA that are subsequently distributed from the PLlan in accordance with the permissible withdrawal provisions
found in Plan Section 5.01(A)(2) will not be included for purposes of calculating the dollar limitation contained in Code section 402(g). In the case of
a Participant age 50 or over by the end of the taxable year, the dollar limitation described in the preceding sentence is increased by the amount of
Elective Deferrals that can be Catch-up Contributions. The dollar limitation contained in Code section 402(g) was $17,000 for taxable years beginning
in 2012. This limit is adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury, in multiples of $500, for cost-of-living increases under Code section 402(g)(4).

applies for eligibility purposes.
ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYER FOR SIMPLE 401(k) PLAN
Means, with respect to any SIMPLE 401(k) Year, an Employer that had no more than 100 Employees who received at least $5,000 of Compensation, or
such lesser amount indicated in the Adoption Agreement, from the Employer for the preceding SIMPLE 401(k) Year and is therefore eligible to

Employees of trades or businesses (whether incorporated or not) under common control under Code section 414(c), all Employees of affiliated
service groups under Code section 414(m), and Leased Employees required to be treated as the Employer’s Employees under Code section 414(n),

accrued benefits on behalf of an Eligible Employee under any other plan, contract, pension or trust maintained by the Employer.
An Eligible Employer that adopts a SIMPLE 401(k) and that fails to be an Eligible Employer for any subsequent SIMPLE 401(k) Year is treated as an
Eligible Employer for the two SIMPLE 401(k) Years following the last SIMPLE 401(k) Year for which the Employer was an Eligible Employer. If the
failure is due to any acquisition, disposition, or similar transaction involving an Eligible Employer, the preceding sentence applies only if the
provisions of Code section 410(b)(6)(C)(i) are satisfied.
ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANT
Means any Employee who is eligible to make a Nondeductible Employee Contribution or an Elective Deferral (if the Employer takes such
contributions into account in the calculation of the Contribution Percentages), or to receive a Matching Contribution (including Forfeitures) or a
Qualified Matching Contribution.
If a Nondeductible Employee Contribution is required as a condition of participation in the Plan, any Employee who would be a Participant in the
Plan if such Employee made such a contribution will be treated as an Eligible Participant on behalf of whom no Nondeductible Employee
Contributions are made.

procedures as such managing body may provide. Each such person will be bonded as may be required by law. The term Plan Administrator will
include any person authorized to perform the duties of the Plan Administrator and properly identified to the Trustee or Custodian as such. Where the
Adopting Employer dies, becomes incapacitated, or is otherwise unable to fulfill its duties, and neither the Adopting Employer nor the managing

Administrator may appoint a successor Plan Administrator. Where the Plan Administrator will not or cannot appoint a successor Plan Administrator, a
majority of Participants in the Plan will have the authority to appoint a successor Plan Administrator but will not be obligated to do so if engaging a
majority of Participants would result in unreasonable time, expense, or administrative burden. The Pre-approved Document Provider will in no case
be designated as the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator will be a named Fiduciary of the Plan for purposes of ERISA section 402(a), and the

QUALIFIED DOMESTIC RELATIONS ORDER
A. In General – Means a Domestic Relations Order
1. that creates or recognizes the existence of an Alternate Payee’s rights to, or assigns to an Alternate Payee the right to, receive all or a
portion of the benefits payable with respect to a Participant under the Plan, and
E
2. with respect to which the requirements described in the remainder of this section are met.
B. Specification of Facts – A Domestic Relations Order will be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order only if the order clearly specifies
1. the name and last known mailing address (if any) of the Participant and the name and mailing address of each Alternate Payee covered by
the order,
2. the amount or percentage of the Participant’s benefits to be paid by the Plan to each such Alternate Payee, or the manner in which such

QUALIFIED ELECTION
A
Means a waiver of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or a Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity. Any waiver of a Qualified Joint and Survivor
Annuity or a Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity will not be effective unless 1) the Participant’s Spouse consents to the election (either in writing
or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL), 2) the election designates a specific Beneficiary, including any class of
beneficiaries or any contingent beneficiaries, that may not be changed without spousal consent (or the Spouse expressly permits designations by the
Participant without any further spousal consent), 3) the Spouse’s consent acknowledges the effect of the election, and d) the Spouse’s consent is
witnessed by a Plan representative or notary public. Additionally, a Participant’s waiver of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity will not be
effective unless the election designates a form of benefit payment that may not be changed without spousal consent (or the Spouse expressly
Spermits designations by the Participant without any further spousal consent). If it is established to the satisfaction of a Plan representative that there
is no Spouse or that the Spouse cannot be located, a waiver by the Participant will be deemed a Qualified Election. In addition, if the Spouse is legally
incompetent to give consent, the Spouse’s legal guardian, even if the guardian is the Participant, may give consent. If the Participant is legally
separated or the Participant has been abandoned (within the meaning of local law) and the Participant has a court order to such effect, spousal
consent is not required unless a Qualified Domestic Relations Order provides otherwise.
Any consent by a Spouse obtained under this provision (or establishment that the consent of a Spouse may not be obtained) will be effective only
with respect to such Spouse. A consent that permits designations by the Participant without any requirement of further consent by such Spouse must
acknowledge that the Spouse has the right to limit consent to a specific Beneficiary, and a specific form of benefit where applicable, and that the
Spouse voluntarily elects to relinquish either or both of such rights. A revocation of a prior waiver may be made by a Participant without the consent
of the Spouse at any time before the commencement of benefits. The number of revocations will not be limited. No consent obtained under this
provision will be valid unless the Participant has received notice as provided in Plan Section 5.10(D).

Agreement, will be eligible to participate in this Plan upon satisfying the age and eligibility service requirements specified in the Adoption
Agreement. If no age is specified in the Adoption Agreement, there will not be an age requirement. If no option for eligibility service is

L
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if the Adoption Agreement does not give Employers the option to restrict participation of
certain classes of Employees, the following Employees will be excluded from participation in the Plan.
A. Union Employees – Employees included in a unit of Employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement between the Employer
and Employee representatives, if retirement benefits were the subject of good faith bargaining and if two-percent or less of the
Employees who are covered pursuant to that agreement are professionals as defined in Treasury Regulation section 1.410(b)-9. For
P
this purpose, the term “Employee representatives” does not include any organization in which more than half of the members are
Employees who are owners, officers, or executives of the Employer.

under the Prior Plan Document before the Effective Date will continue to be a Participant in this Plan.
B. AEffective Date – If this is an initial adoption of the Plan by the Employer, an Employee will become a Participant in the Plan as of the
Effective Date if the Employee has met the eligibility requirements of Plan Section 2.01 as of such date. After the Effective Date, each
Employee will become a Participant on the first Entry Date coinciding with or following the date the Employee satisfies the eligibility

furnish the Employee with the enrollment forms or other documents that are required of Participants. Such notification will be in
Swriting, or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS or DOL. The Employee will execute such forms or
documents and make available such information as may be required in the administration of the Plan.
2.03 TRANSFER TO OR FROM AN INELIGIBLE CLASS
If an Employee who had been a Participant becomes ineligible to participate because they are no longer a member of an eligible class of
Employees, but has not incurred a Break in Eligibility Service, such Employee will participate immediately following the date of
reemployment upon their return to an eligible class of Employees. If such Employee incurs a Break in Eligibility Service, their eligibility to
participate will be determined by Plan Section 2.04.
An Employee who is not a member of the eligible class of Employees will become a Participant immediately upon becoming a member of
the eligible class, provided such Employee has satisfied the age and eligibility service requirements and would have otherwise previously
become a Participant. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, if such Employee has not satisfied the age and eligibility
service requirements as of the date they become a member of the eligible class, such Employee will become a Participant on the first Entry
Date coinciding with or following the date that the Employee has satisfied the age and eligibility service requirements.
2.04 ELIGIBLITY TO PARTICIPATE AFTER A BREAK IN ELIGIBILITY SERVICE OR UPON REHIRE
A. Employee Not a Participant Before Break – If an Employee incurs a Break in Eligibility Service before satisfying the Plan’s eligibility
requirements, such Employee’s eligibility service before such Break in Eligibility Service will not be taken into account when determining
the Employee’s eligibility to participate in the Plan following the Break in Eligibility Service.

Participant will continue to participate in the Plan following such Break in Eligibility Service. If a Participant incurs a Termination of
Employment such Participant will participate immediately following the date of reemployment, except as set forth in Plan Section
2.04(C).

C. Rehire Hold-Out Rule – If elected in the Adoption Agreement, eligibility service that occurs before a Break in Eligibility Service will
not be taken into account until the Participant (without regard to whether the Participant is Vested) has satisfied the Plan’s eligibility
service requirement after returning to employment. The eligibility service for purposes of the rehire hold-out rule will be measured in
the same manner as the original Eligibility Computation Period, if applicable, except that it will commence on the Participant’s
reemployment commencement date. The reemployment commencement date is the first day on which the Participant is credited with
an Hour of Service for the performance of duties after reemployment. If a Participant completes the eligibility service requirements
E
following reemployment in accordance with this paragraph, their active participation will be reinstated as of the reemployment
commencement date. Notwithstanding the preceding, Plan Section 2.04(B) will apply to Elective Deferrals.
2.05 DETERMINATIONS UNDER THIS SECTION
The Plan Administrator will determine the eligibility of each Employee to be a Participant. This determination will be conclusive and
binding upon all persons except as otherwise provided herein or by law.
2.06 TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT L
Nothing with respect to the establishment of the Plan or any action taken with respect to the Plan, nor the fact that a common law
Employee has become a Participant will give to that Employee any right to employment or continued employment or to grant any other
rights except as specifically set forth in this Plan document, ERISA, or other applicable law. In addition, the Plan will not limit the right of

with respect to the type of Elective Deferral for which they have satisfied the eligibility requirements, on the first Entry Date coinciding
with or following the date the Employee satisfies the eligibility requirements, or if applicable, the first Entry Date following the date on
which the Employee returns to the eligible class of Employees pursuant to Plan Section 2.03. A Participant who wishes to enroll as a
Contributing Participant must deliver (either in writing or in any other form permitted by the IRS and the DOL) a salary reduction
agreement (or agreement to make Nondeductible Employee Contributions) to the Plan Administrator except as set forth in Plan Section
3.01(E) below. Except for occasional, bona fide administrative considerations as set forth in the Treasury Regulations, contributions made
pursuant to such election cannot precede the earlier of 1) the date on which services relating to the contribution are performed, and
A2) the date on which the Compensation that is subject to the election would be payable to the Employee in the absence of an election to
defer. Any limits on Elective Deferrals designated by the Employer in Adoption Agreement Section Three may be determined either
periodically throughout the Plan Year (e.g., each payroll period) or at the end of the Plan Year provided that the determination is made in
a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner.
Notwithstanding the dates set forth in Plan Section 3.01(A) as of which a Participant may enroll as a Contributing Participant, the Plan
Administrator will have the authority to designate, in a nondiscriminatory manner, additional enrollment dates during the 12-month
period beginning on the Effective Date (or the date that Elective Deferrals may commence, if later) in order that an orderly first
Senrollment might be completed. In addition, if the Adopting Employer has indicated in the Adoption Agreement that Participants may
make separate deferral elections with respect to bonuses, Participants will be afforded a reasonable period of time before the
issuance of such bonuses to elect to defer all, none, or part of them into the Plan. Such an election to defer all or part of a bonus will
be independent of any other salary reduction agreement and will not constitute a modification to any pre-existing salary reduction
agreement. If a Plan permits both Pre-Tax and Roth Elective Deferrals and the Participant fails to designate whether their Elective
Deferrals are Pre-Tax or Roth Elective Deferrals, the Participant will be deemed to have designated the Elective Deferrals as Pre-Tax
Elective Deferrals.
Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, if this Plan is subject to ERISA, the Employer shall deliver Elective Deferrals to the
Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) as soon as such contributions can reasonably be segregated from the general assets of the Employer.
In no event, however, will Elective Deferrals be deposited with the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) later than the 15th business day of
the month following the month in which the Elective Deferrals would otherwise have been payable to a Participant in cash or by such
other deadline determined under rules promulgated by the DOL. If this Plan is not subject to ERISA, the Employer shall deposit Elective
Deferrals with the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) as of such time as is required by the IRS and DOL.
B. Ceasing Elective Deferrals – Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, a Participant may cease Elective Deferrals (or
Nondeductible Employee Contributions) and thus withdraw as a Contributing Participant as of any such times established by the Plan
Administrator in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner by revoking the authorization to the Employer to make Elective Deferrals
(or Nondeductible Employee Contributions) on their behalf. A Participant who desires to withdraw as a Contributing Participant will
give notice of withdrawal to the Plan Administrator at least 30 days (or such shorter period as the Plan Administrator will permit in a
uniform and nondiscriminatory manner) before the effective date of withdrawal. A Participant will cease to be a Contributing
Participant upon their Termination of Employment or on account of termination of the Plan. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to
the contrary, each Employee who has entered into a salary reduction agreement under a SIMPLE 401(k) Plan may terminate such
agreement at any time during the year.

[PAGE 27]
C. Return as a Contributing Participant After Ceasing Elective Deferrals – Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, a
Participant who has withdrawn as a Contributing Participant (e.g., pursuant to Plan Section 3.01(B), a suspension due to a hardship
distribution, or a suspension due to a distribution on account of a Deemed Severance from Employment) may not again become a
Contributing Participant until such times established by the Plan Administrator in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner.
D. Changing Elective Deferral Amounts – A Contributing Participant or a Participant who has met the eligibility requirements in the
Adoption Agreement, but who has never made an affirmative election regarding Elective DEeferrals (or Nondeductible Employee
Contributions), may complete a new or modify an existing salary reduction agreement (or agreement to make Nondeductible
Employee Contributions) to increase or decrease (within the limits placed on Elective Deferrals or Nondeductible Employee
Contributions in the Adoption Agreement) the amount of their Compensation deferred into the Plan or change the type of their
future Elective Deferrals (Roth or Pre-Tax), if applicable. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, such modification may
be made as of such times established by the Plan Administrator in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. A modification that
results in the amount of the Participant’s Compensation being deferred into the Plan being zero (0) will be considered a cessation of
deferrals under the Plan. A Contributing Participant who desires to makLe such a modification will complete and deliver (either in
writing or in any other form permitted by the IRS and the DOL) a new salary reduction agreement (or agreement to make
Nondeductible Employee Contributions to the Plan Administrator). The Plan Administrator may prescribe such uniform and
nondiscriminatory rules as it deems appropriate to carry out the terms of this Plan Section 3.01(D).
E. Automatic Contribution Arrangements and Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangements
1. Automatic Contribution Arrangement (ACA)P – Each Employee who satisfies the eligibility requirements specified in the Adoption
Agreement for Elective Deferrals will be given a reasonable opportunity to enroll as a Contributing Participant. Notwithstanding
the preceding, if the Adopting Employer so elected in the Adoption Agreement, the Employer will make ACA contributions as
Elective Deferrals on behalf of those Employees who are eligible to participate. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption
Agreement, Elective Deferrals will be made on behalf of those Employees who are hired on or after the Effective Date and have
made a timely affirmative election to defer at a rate, including zero percent, that is less than the rate selected in the Adoption
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, Employees may modify a salary reduction agreement to
prospectively increase or decrease the amount of their Elective Deferrals upon any adoption of or changes to the ACA elections
in the AdoptionM Agreement. The Employer will apply a uniform policy to determine whether a Participant has made a timely
affirmative election. A Contributing Participant may modify a salary reduction agreement to prospectively increase or decrease
the amount of their Elective Deferrals Elective Deferrals for such Employee will continue at the rate specified in the Adoption
Agreement until 1) the Employee provides the Employer a salary reduction agreement (either in writing or in any other form
permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and the DOL) to the contrary, or unless 2) the Employer reduces, ceases, or
suspends Elective Deferrals made on behalf of Employees so as not to exceed the limits of the Code and other rules
promulgated by the IRS (e.g., Code sections 401(a)(17), 402(g), and 415 or to comply with Treasury Regulation section
1.401(k)-3(c)(v)(B)), or 3) Elective Deferrals are increased in accordance with Plan Section 3.01(E)(3). Unless otherwise elected in
the Adoption Agreement or as otherwise indicated in rules promulgated by the IRS, Elective Deferrals made to the Plan pursuant
Ato the ACA provisions will be subject to any other Plan rules otherwise applicable to Elective Deferrals. Unless otherwise elected
in the Adoption Agreement, the initial default contribution rate will be three-percent and the Elective Deferrals will be pre-tax
Elective Deferrals.
An Employer who adopts the ACA provisions will comply with the notice requirements described in item 4 below.
An Employer who adopts the ACA provisions as described in this Plan Section 3.01(E)(1) will establish uniform and nondiscriminatory
procedures designed to ensure that all Employees who are eligible to participate or Contributing Participants are provided with an
effective opportunity to make or modify their salary deferral elections. Such procedures will include, but are not limited to, the
S
means by which notice will be provided to each Employee or Contributing Participant of their right to complete a salary reduction
agreement specifying a different amount or percentage of Compensation (including no Compensation) to be contributed to the
Plan and a reasonable period of time for completing such a salary reduction agreement.
2. Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangement (EACA) – Each Employee who satisfies the eligibility requirements specified in the
Adoption Agreement for Elective Deferrals will be given a reasonable opportunity to enroll as a Contributing Participant.
Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Adopting Employer so elected in the Adoption Agreement, the Employer will make EACA
contributions as Elective Deferrals on behalf of those Employees who are eligible to participate. Unless otherwise elected in the
Adoption Agreement, Elective Deferrals will be made on behalf of those Employees who are hired on or after the Effective Date
and have made a timely affirmative election to defer at a rate, including zero percent, that is less than the rate selected in the
Adoption Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, Employees may modify a salary reduction agreement
to prospectively increase or decrease the amount of their Elective Deferrals upon any adoption of or changes to the EACA
elections in the Adoption Agreement. The Employer will apply a uniform policy to determine whether a Participant has made a
timely affirmative election. The rate selected in the Adoption Agreement must be applied uniformly except as otherwise provided
in Treasury Regulation section 1.414(w)-1(b)(2) and will continue at the rate specified in the Adoption Agreement until 1) the
Employee provides the Employer a salary reduction agreement (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules
promulgated by the IRS and the DOL) to the contrary, or unless 2) the Employer reduces, ceases, or suspends Elective Deferrals
made on behalf of Employees so as not to exceed the limits of the Code and other rules promulgated by the IRS (e.g., Code
sections 401(a)(17), 402(g), and 415 or to comply with Treasury Regulation section 1.401(k)-3(c)(v)(B)) or 3) Elective Deferrals are
increased in accordance with Plan Section 3.01(E)(3). Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement or as otherwise
indicated in rules promulgated by the IRS, Elective Deferrals made to the Plan pursuant to the EACA provisions will be subject to
any other Plan rules otherwise applicable to Elective Deferrals. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, the initial
default contribution rate will be three-percent and the Elective Deferrals will be pre-tax Elective Deferrals.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 22 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 28]
An Employer who adopts the EACA provisions described in this Plan Section 3.01(E)(2) will establish uniform and nondiscriminatory
procedures designed to ensure that all Employees who are eligible to participate or Contributing Participants are provided with an
effective opportunity to make and modify their salary deferral elections. Such procedures will include, but are not be limited to, the
means by which notice will be provided to each Employee or Contributing Participant of the right to complete a salary reduction
agreement specifying a different amount or percentage of Compensation (including no Compensation) to be contributed to the
Plan, and a reasonable period for completing such a salary reduction agreement.
E
An Employer who adopts the EACA provisions will comply with the notice requirements and election period described in items 4 and
5 below.
An Employer who makes EACA contributions as Elective Deferrals on behalf of those Employees who are eligible to participate
and who are designated in the Adoption Agreement, if applicable, will be deemed to have affected those Employees for
purposes of the EACA notice requirements. Participants with salary reduction agreements will be deemed to be affected for
purposes of the EACA notice requirements where the Employer makes EACA contributions as Elective Deferrals on behalf of
L
those current Employees designated in the Adoption Agreement. As a result, Participants with salary reduction agreements must
also be provided with a notice pursuant to the EACA notice requirements described in item 4 below.
3. Increase of Automatic Elective Deferral – If the Adopting Employer so elects in the Adoption Agreement, the Elective Deferral
percentage or amount for Contributing Participants who are automatically enrolled pursuant to the ACA and EACA Plan provisions
will be adjusted automatically by the Employer in the increments and time periods stated in the Adoption Agreement.
P
4. Notice Requirement
a. ACA – A comprehensive notice of the Employee’s rights and obligations under the Plan, written in a manner calculated to
be understood by the average Employee, will be provided to affected Participants within a reasonable period of time before
the date which the ACA becomes effective and before each subsequent Plan Year pursuant to rules promulgated by the IRS
or DOL.
b. EACA – A comprehensive notice of the Employee’s rights and obligations under the Plan, written in a manner calculated to be
understoodM by the average Employee which meets the content requirements of Code section 414(w)(4) and its associated
regulations and other guidance, will be provided to affected Participants within a reasonable period of time before the start of
the first Plan Year in which the EACA provisions become effective and before each subsequent Plan Year. The notice will
accurately describe (1) the amount of the default Elective Deferrals that will be made on the Employee’s behalf, (b) the
Employee’s right to elect to have a different Elective Deferral withheld including the right to not make Elective Deferrals at all,
and (c) how Elective Deferral will be invested if the Employee does not provide investment instructions. A period of 30 to 90 days
before the beginning of the Plan Year is deemed to be a reasonable period. Whether a different period is reasonable will be
determined based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. If a Plan has an eligibility period of less than 30 days (e.g.,
immediate eligibility), the Plan can provide the notice to Participants when they become eligible. If notice cannot be provided on
or before the Employee’s eligibility date, it will be deemed timely if it is provided as soon as practicable after that date and
A
before the pay date for the payroll period in which the Employee becomes eligible. In such case, the Employee must be allowed
to defer from Compensation earned beginning on the date the Employee enters the Plan.
Notwithstanding the preceding, the Employer may change these notice requirements pursuant to rules promulgated by the
IRS or DOL.
5. EACA Election Periods – In addition to any other election periods provided under the Plan, each Employee who is eligible to
participate may make or modify a deferral election during a reasonable period of time immediately following receipt of the
S
notice described above. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Employer may change the election periods described above
pursuant to rules promulgated by the IRS or DOL.
6. Reset Rule
a. ACA – An Employee who is rehired following a Termination of Employment will be treated as a new Employee for purposes
of determining their appropriate Elective Deferral rate, regardless of their Elective Deferral rate prior to their Termination of
Employment. The Employer will make ACA contributions as Elective Deferrals on behalf of the rehired Employee at the rate
specified in the Adoption Agreement until the rate of such Elective Deferrals is changed in accordance with Plan Section
3.01(E)(1).
b. EACA – An Employee who is rehired after a Termination of Employment and for whom no Compensation is automatically
withheld and contributed to the Plan as an Elective Deferral during the Plan Year immediately preceding the Employee’s
date of rehire will be treated as a new Employee upon rehire for purposes of determining the appropriate Elective Deferral
rate and the availability of permissible withdrawals. An Employee who is rehired after a Termination of Employment and for
whom Compensation was last automatically withheld and contributed to the Plan as an Elective Deferral during the Plan
Year immediately preceding the Employee’s date of rehire will be treated as not having terminated for purposes of
determining the appropriate Elective Deferral rate. In addition, any increase of the rate of EACA contributions that would
have been automatically withheld had the Employee not had a Termination of Employment will be taken into account to
determine the appropriate Elective Deferral rate.

[PAGE 29]
F. Qualified Automatic Contribution Arrangement (QACA) – If the Adopting Employer has elected the QACA option in the Adoption
Agreement, and if these QACA provisions are followed for the Plan Year, then any provisions relating to the ADP Test described in Code
section 401(k)(3) or the ACP Test described in Code section 401(m)(2) will not apply. To the extent that any other provision of the Plan is
inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan Section 3.01(F), the provisions of this section will apply. If the Adopting Employer so provides
in the Adoption Agreement, the QACA Safe Harbor Contributions will be made to the defined contribution plan indicated in the Adoption
Agreement and not to this Plan. However, even though another plan is listed in the Adoption Agreement, such contributions will be made
E
to this Plan unless 1) each Eligible Employee under this Plan is also eligible under the other plan, and 2) the other plan has the same Plan
Year as this Plan. Provided the QACA notice provided by the Employer also satisfies the requirements specified in Plan Section
3.01(E)(4)(b), the Plan will be an EACA as well as a QACA.
1. Elective Deferrals – If elected in the Adoption Agreement, the Employer will make QACA contributions as Elective Deferrals to the
Plan on behalf of those Eligible Employees as designated in the Adoption Agreement and in accordance with such uniform policy as
the Employer may use to determine whether a Participant has made a timely affirmative election to defer at a rate, including zero
percent, that is different from the rates selected for this QACA. The rLates selected must be applied uniformly except as otherwise
provided in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(k)-3(j)(2). Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, the initial default
contribution rate will be three-percent and the Elective Deferrals will be pre-tax Elective Deferrals. Notwithstanding anything in this
Plan to the contrary, Employees may modify a salary reduction agreement to prospectively increase or decrease the amount of
their Elective Deferrals upon any adoption of or changes to the QACA elections in the Adoption Agreement.
An Employer who adopts the QACA provisions will establish uniform and nondiscriminatory procedures designed to ensure that
all Eligible Employees or Contributing ParticPipants are provided with an effective opportunity to make and modify their salary
deferral election. Such procedures will include, but not be limited to, the means by which the notice will be provided to each
Eligible Employee or Contributing Participant of the right to complete a salary reduction agreement specifying a different
amount or percentage of Compensation (including no Compensation) to be contributed to the Plan, and a reasonable period for
completing such a salary reduction agreement.
An Employer who adopts the QACA provisions will comply with the notice requirements and election period described in items
(5) and (6) below.
M
2. QACA ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions – Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, in addition to the Elective
Deferrals described in item 1, above, the Employer will make QACA ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions to the Plan according to
the QACA Basic Matching Contributions definition on behalf of each Eligible Employee. If the Employer makes QACA ADP Test
Safe Harbor Contributions to the Plan based on Compensation earned and Elective Deferrals made during a portion of the
Matching Contribution Computation Period (e.g., on a payroll basis when the Matching Contribution Computation Period is Plan
Year), the Employer shall re-calculate (“true-up”) the Matching Contribution based on the Compensation earned and Elective
Deferrals made over the Matching Contribution Computation Period. Such true-up amount shall be made in a uniform and non-
discriminatory manner.
AThe Employer may make QACA ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions at the same time as it contributes Elective Deferrals or at
any other time as permitted by law and regulations. Such QACA ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions will satisfy the ADP and
ACP testing requirements of the Plan, provided such contributions are the only Matching Contributions and nonelective
contributions made to the Plan, in accordance with Code sections 401(k)(13) and 401(m)(12). QACA ADP Test Safe Harbor
Contributions will be made to the designated Employees, and will be Vested according to the vesting schedule selected by the
Employer, as indicated in the Adoption Agreement. QACA Safe Harbor Nonelective Contributions cannot be made with regard
to permitted disparity rules under Code section 401(l). Notwithstanding the preceding, the Employer may reduce, cease, or
suspend Elective Deferrals made on behalf of Eligible Employees so as not to exceed the limits of Code sections 401(a)(17),
S
402(g), and 415, or to comply with Treasury Regulation section 1.401(k)-3(c)(6)(v)(B).
3. QACA ACP Test Safe Harbor Matching Contributions – In addition to the Elective Deferrals described in item 1, above, and the
QACA ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions described in item 2, above, the Employer will make QACA ACP Test Safe Harbor
Matching Contributions, if any, indicated in the Adoption Agreement on behalf of each Eligible Employee. Such additional
contributions are not required. The Employer may make QACA ACP Test Safe Harbor Matching Contributions at the same time
that it contributes Elective Deferrals or at any other time as permitted by law and regulation. If the Employer makes QACA ACP
Test Safe Harbor Matching Contributions to the Plan based on Compensation earned and Elective Deferrals made during a
portion of the Matching Contribution Computation Period (e.g., on a payroll basis when the Matching Contribution Computation
Period is Plan Year), the Employer shall re-calculate (“true-up”) the Matching Contribution based on the Compensation earned
and Elective Deferrals made over the Matching Contribution Computation Period. Such true-up shall be made in a uniform and
non-discriminatory manner.
If the Employer has elected to make ACP Test Safe Harbor Contributions only when needed to use Forfeitures timely, the ACP Test
Safe Harbor Contributions will be allocated in a manner that matches each Contributing Participant’s Elective Deferrals that do not
exceed a permissible percentage of the Contributing Participant’s Compensation for the Plan Year. If the Employer makes QACA
ACP Test Safe Harbor Matching Contributions, such contributions will satisfy the ACP safe harbor requirements of Code section
401(m)(12), provided that they do not exceed statutory limits of Code sections 401(k)(13) and 401(m)(12) as described in the
Adoption Agreement. Matching Contributions made to the Plan that exceed the limits of Code sections 401(k)(13) and 401(m)(12)
will subject the Plan to ACP testing.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 24 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 30]
4. QACA Elective Deferral Increases – Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, QACA rate increases will not occur during
the Initial Period. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, after the Initial Period, rate increases will occur on the first
day of each Plan Year at a rate of one-percent per year until a maximum of six-percent is reached. If the Adopting Employer so elects
in the Adoption Agreement, the Elective Deferral percentage or amount for Contributing Participants who are not automatically
enrolled under the QACA provisions will be adjusted automatically by the Employer in the increments and time periods stated in the
Adoption Agreement. In addition to the preceding, the Plan Administrator, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, may
E
establish operational procedures to enable all Contributing Participants, including those who are not automatically enrolled as
Contributing Participants pursuant to the QACA provisions, to elect to have their Elective Deferrals automatically increased.
An Employer who adopts the QACA Elective Deferral increase feature described in this Plan Section 3.01(F)(4) will establish
uniform and nondiscriminatory procedures designed to ensure that each Contributing Participant is provided an effective
opportunity to make and modify their salary deferral election such that QACA Elective Deferral increases will not apply to such
Participant. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, the means by which notice will be provided to each Contributing
Participant of their right to complete a salary reduction agreementL discontinuing QACA Elective Deferral increases and a
reasonable period of time for completing such a salary reduction agreement.
5. QACA Notice Requirement – A comprehensive notice of the Employee’s rights and obligations under the Plan, written in a
manner calculated to be understood by the average Eligible Employee which meets the content requirements of Code section
401(k)(13) and its associated regulations and other guidance, will be provided to affected Participants within a reasonable period
of time before the start of the first Plan Year in which the QACA provisions become effective and before each subsequent Plan
Year. In addition to the requirements found Pin Treasury Regulation section 1.401(k)-3(d), the notice will accurately describe (1)
the amount of the default Elective Deferrals that will be made on the Employee’s behalf, (b) the Employee’s right to elect to have
a different Elective Deferral withheld including the right to not make Elective Deferrals at all, and (c) how Elective Deferral will be
invested if the Employee does not provide investment instructions. A period of 30 to 90 days before the beginning of the Plan
Year is deemed to be a reasonable period. Whether a different period is reasonable will be determined based on all of the
relevant facts and circumstances. If a Plan has an eligibility period of less than 30 days (e.g., immediate eligibility), the Plan can
provide the notice to Participants when they become eligible. If notice cannot be provided on or before the Employee’s
eligibility date, it will be deemed timely if it is provided as soon as practicable after that date and before the pay date for the
M
payroll period in which the Employee becomes eligible. In such case, the Employee must be allowed to defer from
Compensation earned beginning on the date the Employee enters the Plan.
Notwithstanding the preceding, the Employer may change these notice requirements pursuant to rules promulgated by the IRS
or DOL.
Notwithstanding the preceding, the Employer will also satisfy the QACA notice requirements of this Plan Section 3.01(F)(5) if the
Employer provides a contingent notice that would otherwise satisfy the requirements in the preceding paragraph except that, in
lieu of specifying the amount of QACA Safe Harbor Nonelective Contribution, the notice states that the Employer will determine
during the Plan Year whether to make a QACA Safe Harbor Nonelective Contribution. If a contingent notice is provided and the
A
Employer decides to make a QACA Safe Harbor Nonelective Contribution the Employer must deliver a follow-up notice to each
Eligible Employee no later than 30 days (or any other reasonable period) before the last day of the Plan Year notifying the
Employee of the QACA Safe Harbor Nonelective Contribution, and must execute all necessary Plan amendments. If an Employer
fails to provide a follow-up notice, no QACA Safe Harbor Nonelective Contribution will be required, and the Plan will not qualify
as a QACA for that year. The Plan may qualify as a QACA for subsequent years if the proper notice and contribution
requirements are satisfied.
6. QACA Election Periods – In addition to any other election periods provided under the Plan, each Eligible Employee may make or
S
modify a deferral election during a reasonable period of time immediately following receipt of the notice described above.
Notwithstanding the preceding, the Employer may change the election periods described above pursuant to rules promulgated
by the IRS or DOL.
7. QACA Reset Rule – An Employee who is rehired after a Termination of Employment and for whom no Compensation is
automatically withheld and contributed to the Plan as an Elective Deferral during the Plan Year immediately preceding the
Employee’s date of rehire will be treated as a new Employee upon rehire for purposes of determining the appropriate Elective
Deferral rate and the availability of permissible withdrawals. An Employee who is rehired after a Termination of Employment and
for whom Compensation was last automatically withheld and contributed to the Plan as an Elective Deferral during the Plan Year
immediately preceding the Employee’s date of rehire will be treated as not having terminated for purposes of determining the
appropriate Elective Deferral rate. In addition, any increase of the rate of QACA contributions that would have been
automatically withheld had the Employee not had a Termination of Service will be taken into account to determine the
appropriate Elective Deferral rate.
G. Pre-Tax vs. Roth Elective Deferrals – If the Adopting Employer so elects in the Adoption Agreement, each Employee who enrolls as a
Contributing Participant may specify whether their Elective Deferrals are to be characterized as Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals, Roth Elective
Deferrals, or a specified combination. A Contributing Participant’s election will remain in effect until superseded by another election.
Elective Deferrals contributed to the Plan as one type, either Roth or Pre-Tax, may not later be reclassified as the other type. A
Contributing Participant’s Roth Elective Deferrals will be deposited in the Contributing Participant’s Roth Elective Deferral subaccount in
the Plan. No contributions other than Roth Elective Deferrals and properly attributable earnings will be credited to each Contributing
Participant’s Roth Elective Deferral account, and gains, losses, and other credits or charges will be allocated on a reasonable and
consistent basis to such subaccount. Notwithstanding the preceding, Elective Deferrals made pursuant to the ACA, EACA, or QACA
provisions of the Plan will be characterized as Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals unless designated as Roth Elective Deferrals in the Adoption
Agreement and will not be characterized as Nondeductible Employee Contributions.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 25 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 31]
H. Catch-up Contributions – Unless elected otherwise in the Adoption Agreement, all Employees who are eligible to make Elective
Deferrals under this Plan and who are age 50 or older by the end of their taxable year will be eligible to make Catch-up Contributions.
Catch-up Contributions are not subject to the limits on Annual Additions under Code section 415, are not counted in the ADP test,
and are not counted in determining the minimum allocation under Code section 416 (but Catch-up Contributions made in prior years
are counted in determining whether the Plan is top-heavy). Provisions in the Plan relating to Catch-up Contributions apply to Elective
Deferrals made after 2001.
E
I. Elective Deferrals to a SIMPLE 401(k) Plan – Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, if the Employer is an Eligible
Employer for SIMPLE 401(k) Plans and has established a SIMPLE 401(k) Plan, each Eligible Employee may deliver (either in writing or in
any other form permitted by the IRS and the DOL) a salary reduction election and have their Compensation reduced for the SIMPLE
401(k) Year in any amount selected by the Employee subject to the limitation described below. The Employer will make Elective Deferral
contributions to this Plan in the amount by which the Employee’s Compensation has been reduced.
The total Elective Deferrals to a SIMPLE 401(k) Plan for any Eligible Employee cannot exceed the limitation on Elective Deferrals in effect
L
for the SIMPLE 401(k) Year. The dollar limitation on Elective Deferrals to a SIMPLE 401(k) Plan was $11,500 for taxable years beginning in
2012. This limit is adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury, in multiples of $500, for cost-of-living increases under Code section
408(p)(2)(E). The amount of an Eligible Employee’s Elective Deferrals permitted for a SIMPLE 401(k) Year is increased for Employees age
50 or older by the end of the SIMPLE 401(k) Year by the amount of allowable Catch-up Contributions. The dollar limit on Catch-up
Contributions was $2,500 for taxable years beginning in 2012. The $2,500 limit is adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury, in multiples of
$500, for the cost-of-living increases under Code section 414(v)(2)(C). Catch-up Contributions are otherwise treated the same as other
Elective Deferrals. P
In addition to any other election periods provided under the Plan, each Eligible Employee in a SIMPLE 401(k) Plan may make or
modify a salary reduction agreement during the 60-day period immediately preceding each January 1.
For the SIMPLE 401(k) Year an Employee becomes eligible to make Elective Deferral contributions under a SIMPLE 401(k) Plan, the 60-
day election period requirement described above is deemed satisfied if the Employee may make or modify a salary reduction
agreement during a 60-day period that includes either the date the Employee becomes eligible or the day before.
M
To the extent that any other provision of the Plan is inconsistent with the provisions of this section, the provisions of this section
govern.
J. SIMPLE 401(k) Notice Requirements – The Employer will notify each Eligible Employee before the 60-day election period described
in Plan Section 3.01(I) that they can complete a salary reduction agreement or modify a prior salary reduction agreement during that
period. The notification must indicate whether the Employer will provide the three-percent Matching Contribution or a two-percent
nonelective contribution described in Plan Section 3.02.
K. Automatic Increase of Elective Deferrals for Employees Who Are Not Automatically Enrolled – If the Adopting Employer so
elects in the Adoption Agreement, automatic increases of Elective Deferrals will be initiated by the Adopting Employer only for
AEmployees specified in the Adoption Agreement who are not automatically enrolled pursuant to the ACA, EACA, or QACA Plan
provisions. The Elective Deferrals will be adjusted automatically by the Employer in the increments and time periods stated in the
Adoption Agreement.
An Employer who adopts the automatic Elective Deferral increase feature described in this Plan Section 3.01(K) will establish uniform
and nondiscriminatory procedures designed to ensure that each Contributing Participant is provided an effective opportunity to
modify their salary deferral election such that automatic increase of Elective Deferrals will not apply to such Employee. Such
procedures will include, but are not limited to, the means by which notice will be provided to each Employee of their right to opt out
S
of the automatic Elective Deferral increases and a reasonable period of time for completing such procedure.
In addition to the preceding, the Plan Administrator may, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, establish operational procedures to
enable all Contributing Participants, including those who were not automatically enrolled as Contributing Participants pursuant to the
ACA, EACA, or QACA Plan provisions, to elect to have their Elective Deferrals automatically increased.
3.02 MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS
The Employer may make Matching Contributions under the Plan on behalf of Qualifying Contributing Participants if elected in the
Adoption Agreement. To be a Qualifying Contributing Participant for a Plan Year, the Participant must make Elective Deferrals (or
Nondeductible Employee Contributions, if the Employer has agreed to match such contributions) for the Plan Year and satisfy any age and
eligibility service and other requirements that are specified for Matching Contributions in the Adoption Agreement. The Employer may
make Matching Contributions at the same time as it contributes Elective Deferrals or at any other time as permitted by law and regulation.
If the Employer makes Matching Contributions to the Plan based on Compensation earned, and Elective Deferrals (or Nondeductible
Employee Contributions) made, during a portion of the Matching Contribution Computation Period (e.g., on a payroll basis when the
Matching Contribution Computation Period is Plan Year), the Employer shall re-calculate (“true-up”) the Matching Contribution based on
the Compensation earned, and Elective Deferrals (or Nondeductible Employee Contributions) made over the Matching Contribution
Computation Period. Such true-up shall be made in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner.
Effective for Plan Years beginning after the first adoption of a document restated to meet the requirements under Revenue Procedure
2017-41, if a discretionary Matching Contribution formula applies (i.e., a formula that provides an Employer with discretion regarding how
to allocate a Matching Contribution to Qualifying Contributing Participants) and the Employer makes a discretionary Matching
Contribution to the Plan, the Employer must provide the Plan Administrator (or Trustee, if applicable), written instructions describing
(1) how the discretionary Matching Contribution formula will be allocated to Qualifying Contributing Participants (e.g., a uniform
percentage of Elective Deferrals (or Nondeductible Employee Contributions) or a flat dollar amount), (2) the Matching Contribution
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 26 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 32]
Computation Period(s) to which the discretionary Matching Contribution formula applies, and (3) if applicable, a description of each
business location or business classification subject to separate discretionary Matching Contribution allocation formulas. Such instructions
must be provided no later than the date on which the discretionary Matching Contribution is made to the Plan. A summary of these
instructions must be communicated to Qualifying Contributing Participants no later than 60 days following the date on which the last
discretionary Matching Contribution is made to the Plan for a Plan Year.
For Plan Years beginning in 2006 (or such earlier date on which the final regulations under TreaEsury Regulation section 1.401(k) and
1.401(m) became effective), Matching Contributions with respect to a non-Highly Compensated Employee taken into account under the
Actual Contribution Percentage (ACP) test cannot exceed the greatest of 1) five-percent of Compensation, 2) the amount of the Qualifying
Contributing Participant’s Elective Deferrals, and 3) the product of two times the plan’s representative matching rate and the Qualifying
Contributing Participant’s Elective Deferrals for a year. The “representative matching rate,” for this purpose, is the lowest matching rate for
any eligible non-Highly Compensated Employee among a group of eligible non-Highly Compensated Employees that consists of one-half
of all non-Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year who make Elective Deferrals for the Plan Year (or if greater, the lowest
matching rate for all eligible non-Highly Compensated Employees in the PlanL who are employed by the Employer on the last day of the
Plan Year and who make Elective Deferrals for the Plan Year). The “matching rate” is generally the Matching Contribution made for a
Qualifying Contributing Participant, divided by their Elective Deferrals for the year. If the matching rate is not the same for all levels of
Elective Deferrals, the matching rate is determined assuming that a Qualifying Contributing Participant’s Elective Deferrals are equal to six-
percent of Compensation.
Notwithstanding the preceding, if an Eligible Employer has established a SIMPLE 401(k) Plan, the Employer will contribute a Matching
Contribution to the Plan on behalf of each Employee wPho makes an Elective Deferral contribution as set forth in Plan Section 3.01(I). The
amount of the Matching Contribution will be equal to the Employee’s Elective Deferral contribution up to a limit of three percent of the
Employee’s Compensation for the entire SIMPLE 401(k) Year. For any year, instead of a Matching Contribution to a SIMPLE 401(k) Plan,
however, the Employer may elect to contribute a nonelective contribution of two-percent of Compensation for the full SIMPLE 401(k) Year
for each Eligible Employee who received at least $5,000 of Compensation (or such lesser amount as elected by the Employer in the
Adoption Agreement) for the SIMPLE 401(k) Year.
3.03 SAFE HARBOR CODA
M
If the Employer has elected the Safe Harbor CODA option in the adoption Agreement, the provisions of this section shall apply for the Plan
Year and any provisions relating to the ADP test described in Code section 401(k)(3) or the ACP test described in Code section 401(m)(2)
do not apply. To the extent that any other provision of the Plan is inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan Section 3.03, the provisions of
this Section 3.03 will apply. If the Adopting Employer so provides in the Adoption Agreement, the Safe Harbor Contributions will be made to
the defined contribution plan indicated in the Adoption Agreement and not to this Plan. However, even though another plan is listed in the
Adoption Agreement, such contributions will be made to this Plan unless 1) each Eligible Employee under this Plan is also eligible under the
other plan, and 2) the other plan has the same Plan Year as this Plan.
An Employer who adopts the Safe Harbor CODA provisions will comply with the notice requirements and election period described in items
PlanA Sections 3.03(C) and (D) below.
In accordance with Treasury Regulation sections 1.401(k)-1(e)(7) and 1.401(m)-1(c)(2), it is impermissible for the Employer to use ADP and ACP
testing for a Plan Year in which it is intended for the Plan to be a Code section 401(k) safe harbor plan and Code section 401(m) safe harbor
plan through its written terms, and the Employer fails to satisfy the requirements of such safe harbors for the Plan Year.
A. ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions – Unless such contributions are otherwise limited in the Adoption Agreement, the Employer will
make the ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions, if any, indicated in the Adoption Agreement on behalf of each Eligible Employee. The
Employer may make ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions at the same time as it contributes Elective Deferrals or at any other time as
S
permitted by law and regulation. If the Employer makes ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions to the Plan based on Compensation
earned and Elective Deferrals made during a portion of the Matching Contribution Computation Period (e.g., on a payroll basis when
the Matching Contribution Computation Period is Plan Year), the Employer shall re-calculate (“true-up”) the Matching Contribution
based on the Compensation earned and Elective Deferrals made over the Matching Contribution Computation Period. Such true-up
shall be made in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner.
In addition, such contributions cannot be made with regard to permitted disparity rules under Code section 401(l).
B. ACP Test Safe Harbor Matching Contributions – In addition to the ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions described in the Definition
Section of the Plan, the Employer will make the ACP Test Safe Harbor Matching Contributions, if any, indicated in the Adoption Agreement
on behalf of each Eligible Employee for the Plan Year. The Employer may make ACP Test Safe Harbor Contributions at the same time as it
contributes Elective Deferrals or at any other time as permitted by law and regulation. If the Employer makes ACP Test Safe Harbor
Matching Contributions to the Plan based on Compensation earned and Elective Deferrals made during a portion of the Matching
Contribution Computation Period (e.g., on a payroll basis when the Matching Contribution Computation Period is Plan Year), the
Employer shall re-calculate (“true-up”) the Matching Contribution based on the Compensation earned and Elective Deferrals made over
the Matching Contribution Computation Period. Such true-up shall be made in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner.
If the Employer has elected to make ACP Test Safe Harbor Contributions only when needed to use Forfeitures timely, the ACP Test
Safe Harbor Contributions will be allocated in a manner that matches each Contributing Participant’s Elective Deferrals that do not
exceed a permissible percentage of the Contributing Participant’s Compensation for the Plan Year. If the Employer makes ACP Test
Safe Harbor Matching Contributions, such contributions will satisfy the ACP safe harbor requirements of Code section 401(m)(11),
provided that they do not exceed statutory limits of Code sections 401(k)(12) and 401(m)(11) as described in the Adoption
Agreement. Matching Contributions made to the Plan that exceed the limits of Code sections 401(k)(12) and 401(m)(11) will subject
the Plan to ACP testing.

[PAGE 33]
C. Notice Requirement – At least 30 days, but not more than 90 days, or any other reasonable period before the beginning of the Plan
Year (or such other times if permitted by the IRS), the Employer will provide each Eligible Employee with a comprehensive notice of
the Employee’s rights and obligations under the Plan, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average Eligible
Employee. If an Employee becomes eligible after the 90th day before the beginning of the Plan Year and does not receive the notice
for that reason, the notice must be provided no more than 90 days before the Employee becomes eligible but not later than the date
the Employee becomes eligible. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Employer may change this notice requirement pursuant to rules
E
promulgated by the IRS.
Notwithstanding the preceding, the Employer will also satisfy the notice requirements of this Plan Section 3.03(C) if the Employer
provides a contingent notice that would otherwise satisfy the requirements in the preceding paragraph, except that in lieu of
specifying the amount of the ADP Test Safe Harbor Contribution, the notice states that the Employer will determine during the Plan
Year whether to make a Safe Harbor Nonelective Contribution. If a contingent notice is provided and the Employer decides to make a
Safe Harbor Nonelective Contribution, the Employer must deliver a follow-up notice to each Eligible Employee no later than 30 days
(or any other reasonable period) before the last day of the Plan Year noLtifying them of the Safe Harbor Nonelective Contribution and
must execute all necessary Plan amendments. If an Employer fails to provide a follow-up notice, no Safe Harbor Nonelective
Contribution will be required, and the Plan will not qualify as a Safe Harbor CODA for that year. The Plan may qualify as a Safe Harbor
CODA for subsequent years if the proper notice and contribution requirements are satisfied.
D. Election Periods – In addition to any other election periods provided under the Plan, each Eligible Employee may make or modify a
deferral election during the 30-day period immediately following receipt of the notice described in Plan Section 3.03(C) above.
Notwithstanding the preceding, the Employer may Pchange the election periods described above pursuant to rules promulgated by the IRS.
3.04 EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS
A. Obligation to Contribute – Except as otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, the Employer may contribute an amount to be
determined from year to year. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, if this Plan is a profit sharing plan, the Employer
may, in its sole discretion, make contributions without regard to current or accumulated earnings or profits.
B. Allocation Formula Mand the Right to Share in the Employer Contribution
1. General – Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, Employer Profit Sharing Contributions will be allocated to all
Qualifying Participants using a pro rata allocation formula. Under the pro rata allocation formula, Employer Profit Sharing
Contributions will be allocated to the Individual Accounts of Qualifying Participants in the ratio that each Qualifying Participant’s
Compensation for the Plan Year bears to the total Compensation of all Qualifying Participants for the Plan Year. The Employer
Contribution for any Plan Year will be deemed allocated to each Participant’s Individual Account as of the last day of that Plan Year.
Notwithstanding the preceding, Employer Profit Sharing Contributions and Employer Money Purchase Pension Contributions will be
allocated to the Plan on behalf of each Participant who has incurred a Disability and who is a non-Highly Compensated Employee if
Aso specified in the Adoption Agreement and without regard to any allocation conditions. Compensation for such contributions will
be the greater of the Participant’s actual Compensation during the Plan Year or the Compensation the Participant would have
received if the Participant had been paid at the rate of Compensation paid immediately before becoming disabled. Contributions
made with respect to amounts treated as Compensation will be fully Vested when allocated to the Participant, and will be made on
behalf of the disabled Participant until the Participant incurs a Termination of Employment.
Any Employer Contribution for a Plan Year must satisfy Code section 401(a)(4) and the corresponding Treasury Regulations for
such Plan Year.
S
2. Special Rules for Integrated Plans –
a. Excess Integrated Allocation Formula – If the Adopting Employer has selected the excess integrated allocation formula in the
Adoption Agreement, subject to the overall permitted disparity limits, Employer Profit Sharing Contributions will be
allocated as follows (the Employer may start with Step 3 if this Plan is not top-heavy or if the Plan is top-heavy but has
already satisfied the top-heavy contribution requirements).
Step 1. Employer Profit Sharing Contributions will first be allocated pro rata to Qualifying Participants in the manner
described in Plan Section 3.04(B)(1). The percent so allocated under Step 1 will not exceed three-percent of each
Qualifying Participant’s Compensation.
Step 2. Any Employer Profit Sharing Contributions remaining after the allocation in Step 1 will be allocated to each
Qualifying Participant’s Individual Account in the ratio that each Qualifying Participant’s Compensation for the
Plan Year in excess of the integration level bears to all Qualifying Participants’ Compensation in excess of the
integration level, but not in excess of three-percent of each Qualifying Participant’s Compensation. For purposes
of this Step 2, in the case of any Qualifying Participant who has exceeded the cumulative permitted disparity limit
described below, such Qualifying Participant’s total compensation for the Plan Year will be taken into account.
Step 3. Any Employer Profit Sharing Contributions remaining after the allocation in Step 2 will be allocated to each
Qualifying Participant’s Individual Account in the ratio that the sum of each Qualifying Participant’s total
Compensation and Compensation in excess of the integration level bears to the sum of all Qualifying
Participants’ total Compensation and Compensation in excess of the integration level, but not in excess of the
applicable profit sharing maximum disparity rate as described below. For purposes of this Step 3, in the case of
any Qualifying Participant who has exceeded the cumulative permitted disparity limit described below, two times
such Qualifying Participant’s total compensation for the Plan Year will be taken into account.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 28 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 34]
Step 4. Any Employer Profit Sharing Contributions remaining after the allocation in Step 3 will be allocated pro rata to
Qualifying Participants in the manner described in Plan Section 3.04(B)(1).
b. Base Integrated Allocation Formula – If the Adopting Employer has selected the base integrated allocation formula in the
Adoption Agreement, subject to the overall permitted disparity limits, Employer Profit Sharing Contributions will be allocated
as follows. The base integrated allocation formula is not available for years in which the Plan is top-heavy. During a Plan Year in
which the Plan is top-heavy, the excess integrated allocation formula must be usedE. No amendment of the Plan is required to
move between the base and excess integration formulas merely on account of the Plan’s change in top-heavy status.
Step 1. Employer Profit Sharing Contributions will first be allocated to each Qualifying Participant’s Individual Account in
the ratio that the sum of each Qualifying Participant’s total Compensation and Compensation in excess of the
integration level bears to the sum of all Qualifying Participants’ total Compensation and Compensation in excess
of the integration level, but not in excess of the non-top-heavy profit sharing maximum disparity rate as
described below.
L
Step 2. Any Employer Profit Sharing Contributions remaining after the allocation in Step 1 will be allocated pro rata to
Qualifying Participants in the manner described in Plan Section 3.04(B)(1).
c. Maximum Disparity Rate – If the Adopting Employer has selected the integrated contribution or allocation formula in the
Adoption Agreement, the integration level will be defined in the Adoption Agreement. If the Adopting Employer has selected
the integrated contribution or allocation formula and no integration level is selected in the Adoption Agreement, the Taxable
P
Wage Base will be the integration level. The maximum disparity rate will be determined in accordance with the following table.
MAXIMUM DISPARITY RATE
Top-Heavy
Integration Level Money Purchase Profit Sharing Non-Top-Heavy Profit Sharing
Taxable Wage Base (TWB) 5.7% 2.7% 5.7%
M
More than $0 but not more
than 20 percent of TWB 5.7% 2.7% 5.7%
More than 20 percent of TWB but
not more than 80 percent of TWB 4.3% 1.3% 4.3%
More than 80 percent of TWB but
less than TWB 5.4% 2.4% 5.4%
A
d. Annual overall permitted disparity limit – Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, for any Plan Year in which this Plan
benefits any Participant who also benefits under another qualified plan or simplified employee pension, as defined in Code
section 408(k), that is maintained by the Employer and that provides for permitted disparity (or imputes disparity), any
Employer Profit Sharing Contributions and forfeitures will be allocated to the account of each Qualifying Participant (except
that Forfeitures will be allocated to all Participants if specified by the Adopting Employer in the Adoption Agreement) in the
ratio that such Qualifying Participant’s total Compensation bears to the total Compensation of all Qualifying Participants. If
this Plan is a money purchase pension plan, Employer Money Purchase Pension Contributions will be made to the account
S
of each Qualifying Participant in an amount equal to the excess contribution percentage multiplied by the Participant’s total
Compensation.
e. Cumulative permitted disparity limit – The cumulative permitted disparity limit for a Participant is 35 total cumulative permitted
disparity years. Total cumulative permitted years means the number of years credited to the Participant for allocation or accrual
purposes under this Plan, or any other qualified plan or simplified employee pension plan (whether or not terminated) ever
maintained by the Employer. For purposes of determining the Participant’s cumulative permitted disparity limit, all years
ending in the same calendar year are treated as the same year. If the Participant has not benefited under a defined benefit or
target benefit plan for any year beginning on or after January 1, 1994, the Participant has no cumulative disparity limit.
Compensation will mean compensation as defined in the Definition section of the Plan, without regard to any exclusions
selected in Adoption Agreement Section Six.
3. Employer Prevailing Wage Contributions – If the Employer so elects in the Adoption Agreement, Employer Prevailing Wage
Contributions will be allocated to Participants with employment covered under a government contract. Unless otherwise elected
in the Adoption Agreement, all Participants who are covered under a government contract will be eligible to receive Employer
Prevailing Wage Contributions and such Employer Prevailing Wage Contributions will offset any other Employer Profit Sharing
Contributions or Employer Money Purchase Pension Plan Contributions to which the Participants may be entitled to for the Plan
Year in which the Employer Prevailing Wage Contribution is made. There will be no eligibility requirements and entry will be
immediate for Employer Prevailing Wage Contributions. For each Hour of Service of covered employment under a government
contract, the Employer will contribute to the Plan such amounts for each Participant as determined by the hourly rate designated
for each Participant’s work classification on the wage determination sheet, or part thereof, as determined by the Employer
pursuant to the terms of the contracts to which the Employer is a party and that are subject to the provisions of any federal,
state, or municipal prevailing wage law to which the Employer is a party.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 29 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 35]
For all purposes under the Plan other than eligibility, contribution, allocation, and vesting determinations (e.g., testing and
distribution eligibility), Employer Prevailing Wage Contributions will be designated as follows.
i. If the Plan is a money purchase pension plan, Employer Prevailing Wage Contributions will be designated as Employer
Money Purchase Pension Plan Contributions.
ii. If the Plan is a profit sharing plan, Employer Prevailing Wage Contributions will bEe designated as Employer Profit Sharing
Contributions.
iii. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, if the Plan is a 401(k) profit sharing plan, Employer Prevailing Wage
Contributions will be designated as Qualified Nonelective Contributions.
4. Minimum Coverage Test – Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Adopting Employer may use either the ratio
percentage test (and the correction option described below, if applicable) or the average benefits test to satisfy the minimum
coverage requirements. This paragraph may apply for any Plan Year that the Plan fails to satisfy the ratio percentage test
L
described in Code section 410(b)(1) as of the last day of any such Plan Year. The ratio percentage test is satisfied if, on the last
day of the Plan Year, taking into account all Employees, or former Employees who were employed by the Employer on any day
during the Plan Year, either the Plan benefits at least 70 percent of Employees who are not Highly Compensated Employees or
the Plan benefits a percentage of Employees who are not Highly Compensated Employees that is at least 70 percent of the
percentage of Highly Compensated Employees benefiting under the Plan. A Participant is treated as benefiting under the Plan
for any Plan Year during which the Participant received or is deemed to receive an allocation in accordance with Code section
P
1.410(b)-3(a). If the Plan fails the ratio percentage test, the Employer Contribution for the Plan Year may be allocated to an
individual Participant, and any similarly situated Participants to the extent necessary, within each of the classes set forth in (i)
through (iii) below, in order of priority, until the Plan satisfies the minimum coverage test. For example, if the Employer
Contribution is allocated to all individuals in the first class of Participants and the Plan still fails, the Employer Contribution will
be allocated to an individual Participant and any other similarly situated Participants in the second class of Participants set forth
below. If the Employer Contribution is allocated to all individuals in the second class of Participants and the Plan still fails, the
Employer Contribution will then be allocated to an individual Participant and any other similarly situated Participants in the third
class of ParticipaMnts set forth below. The classes of Participants to be included are as follows:
i. Each Participant who is still employed on the last day of the Plan Year starting with the Participant who has completed either the
highest number of Hours of Service during the Plan Year, if the Hours of Service method of determining service is used; or the
highest number of days worked during the Plan Year, if the Elapsed Time method of determining service is used;
ii. Each Participant who is not employed on the last day of the Plan Year because the Participant has died, incurred a
Disability, or attained Normal Retirement Age;
iii. Each Participant who is not employed on the last day of the Plan Year starting with the Participant who has completed either
the highest number of Hours of Service during the Plan Year, if the Hours of Service method of determining service is used; or
Athe highest number of days worked during the Plan Year, if the Elapsed Time method of determining service is used.
If the minimum coverage test is performed after any Employer Contribution has been allocated and the Plan fails the minimum
coverage test, the Employer will make an additional contribution to the Plan on behalf of an individual Participant and all
similarly situated Participants to the extent necessary to satisfy testing that are entitled thereto pursuant to the classes of
Participant in (i) through (iii) above. The amount of the contribution for such Participants will be determined pursuant to the
Plan’s allocation formula.
S5. Special Rule for Owner-Employees – If this Plan provides contributions or benefits for one or more Owner-Employees, contributions
on behalf of any Owner-Employee may be made only with respect to the Earned Income of such Owner-Employee.
6. Age-Weighted Allocation Formula – If the age-weighted allocation formula is elected in the Adoption Agreement, the total
Employer Profit Sharing Contribution will be allocated to each Qualifying Participant such that the equivalent benefit accrual rate
for each Qualifying Participant is identical. The equivalent benefit accrual rate is the annual annuity commencing at the
Qualifying Participant’s testing age, expressed as a percentage of the Qualifying Participant’s Compensation, which is provided
from the allocation of Employer Profit Sharing Contributions and Forfeitures for the Plan Year, using standardized actuarial
assumptions that satisfy Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(4)-12. The Qualifying Participant’s testing age is the later of
Normal Retirement Age or the Qualifying Participant’s current age.
a. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, if the age-weighted allocation method is selected, Employer Profit Sharing
Contributions will be allocated to the Individual Accounts of Qualifying Participants in the manner described below.
Step 1. Determine each Qualifying Participant’s number of points based upon the following formula:
Points = .01 x Compensation x allocation factor derived from the allocation factor tables set forth in Adoption
Agreement Section 10.
The pre-retirement and post-retirement interest rate used to calculate the annual Employer Profit Sharing
Contribution will be eight and one-half percent.
Step 2. Determine each Qualifying Participant’s allocation using the following formula:
Points of Qualifying Participant
Allocation = x Employer Profit Sharing Contribution
Total Points of all Qualifying Participants
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 30 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 36]
Step 3. If the Plan has a uniform points allocation for Employer Profit Sharing Contributions, make any reallocations
necessary to satisfy the safe harbor formula.
b. If the age-weighted formula for allocations and the safe harbor requirements of Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(4)-2(b)(3)
are selected in the Adoption Agreement, then, to the extent necessary, the following steps will be taken.
i. Identify the Employees of the Employer who are not Highly Compensated EEmployees of such Employer who
participate in the Plan, and determine the average allocation rate for such group of Employees.
ii. Identify the Employees of the Employer who are Highly Compensated Employees of such Employer who participate in
the Plan, and determine the average allocation rate for such group of Employees.
iii. As of the date of allocation, determine that amount by which the average allocation rate for the group of Participants
who are not Highly Compensated Employees is less than the average allocation rate of the group of the Participants
who are Highly Compensated Employees.
L
iv. Lower the aggregate allocation to all of the Highly Compensated Employees by the amount necessary to cause the
average allocation rate of the Participants who are not Highly Compensated Employees (as determined after including
the amount by which the Highly Compensated Employees’ allocation is lowered and that is subsequently allocated to
the Participants who are not Highly Compensated Employees) to equal the average allocation rate of the Participants
who are Highly Compensated Employees (as determined after the Highly Compensated Employees’ allocation has
been lowered). P
v. Reallocate the aggregate amount of the contributions after the reduction in (iv) above to the Participants who are
Highly Compensated Employees using the allocation formula in the Adoption Agreement; provided that for purposes
of this allocation, “Qualifying Participants” will mean only those Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees
and “Employer Profit Sharing Contributions” will mean only those contributions allocated to Participants who are
Highly Compensated Employees.
vi. Reallocate the aggregate amount of the contributions after the increase in (iv) above to the Participants who are not
M
Highly Compensated Employees using the allocation formula in the Adoption Agreement; provided that for purposes
of this allocation, “Qualifying Participants” will mean only those Participants who are not Highly Compensated
Employees and “Employer Profit Sharing Contributions” will mean only those contributions allocated to Participants
who are not Highly Compensated Employees.
c. If the age-weighted formula for allocations and the general test requirements of Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(4)-2(c) are
selected in the Adoption Agreement, then, to the extent necessary, the following steps will be taken for each rate group of the
Employer that fails to satisfy the rules of that section.
i. Identify the Employees of the Employer who are not Highly Compensated Employees of such Employer who
A
participate in the Plan and who are not part of the applicable rate group because their allocation rates are too low,
and arrange them in order of their allocation rates from the highest to the lowest.
ii. Identify the Highly Compensated Employees who participate in the Plan and are in the rate group and arrange them in
order of their allocation rates from the highest to the lowest.
iii. As of the date of allocation, lower the allocation of the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest allocation rate
determined in (ii) above. The reduction will equal the amount that when added to the Individual Account of the
Sindividual in (i) above who has the highest allocation rate will cause that rate to be increased to equal that of the
Highly Compensated Employee with respect to whom the rate group is constructed. As of the date of allocation, that
reduction will be added to such individual’s Individual Account.
iv. Repeat (iii) above with respect to the individual in (i) above who has the next highest equivalent accrual rate, and
continue that process with the other individuals described in (i) above in the order of their allocation rates from the
highest to the lowest until such rules are satisfied for the rate group. If the allocation rate of a Highly Compensated
Employee is lowered under (iii) above or this clause (iv) to the point where it is equal to that of one or more other
Highly Compensated Employees in the rate group, then any further reductions in allocations will be apportioned
between the former and latter Highly Compensated Employees in a manner that causes their allocation rates to be
reduced by the same amount.
7. New Comparability Formulas
a. Allocation Group Formulas – If the Adopting Employer has selected the individual allocation group formula in the Adoption
Agreement, each Qualifying Participant will constitute a separate allocation group for purposes of allocating Employer Profit
Sharing Contributions. If the Adopting Employer has selected the pre-determined allocation group formula in the Adoption
Agreement Qualifying Participants will be divided into the groups specified in the Adoption Agreement.
The Employer Profit Sharing Contribution will be allocated as follows:
i. The total amount of Employer Profit Sharing Contributions is allocated among the deemed aggregated allocation
groups in portions determined by the Employer. A deemed aggregated allocation group consists of all of the separate
allocation groups that have the same allocation rate.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 31 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 37]
ii. Within each deemed aggregated allocation group, the allocated portion is allocated to each Qualifying Participant in
the ratio that such Qualifying Participant’s Compensation bears to the total Compensation of all Qualifying
Participants in the deemed allocation group unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement.
The number of eligible non-Highly Compensated Employees to which a particular allocation rate applies must reflect a
reasonable classification of Employees. An allocation rate is the amount of Employer Profit Sharing Contributions
allocated to a Qualifying Participant for a Plan Year, expressed as a percentEage of Compensation.
The Employer must provide the Plan Administrator or Trustee, if applicable, written instructions describing the portion of
the Employer Profit Sharing Contribution to be allocated to each allocation group. The instructions must be provided no
later than the Employer’s tax return due date, including extensions, for the tax year that includes the end of the Plan Year
for which the allocation is made.
If the Adopting Employer has chosen pre-determined allocation groups in the Adoption Agreement, the allocation group
to which each Qualifying Participant belongs will be determinLed on a date or dates determined by the Plan Administrator in
a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. A Qualifying Participant is not required to be included in more than one
allocation group for a Plan Year. In the event that a Qualifying Participant is included in more than one allocation group,
the Qualifying Participant’s share of the Employer Profit Sharing Contribution allocated to each group will be based on the
Qualifying Participant’s Compensation for the part of the Plan Year the Participant was in the group.
If a new comparability allocation group formula is selected in the Adoption Agreement, the pre-retirement and post-
P
retirement interest rate assumption will be eight and a half percent and the mortality table will be the UP-1984 Mortality
Table. In addition, unless otherwise specified in the Adoption Agreement the following provisions will apply.
Individual Allocation Groups – Each Qualifying Participant will constitute a separate allocation group.
Pro Rata Formula – If an allocation group formula is selected, Employer Profit Sharing Contributions will be allocated in the
ratio that each Qualifying Participant’s Compensation for the Plan Year bears to the total Compensation of all Qualifying
Participants in the applicable allocation group for the Plan Year. The amounts so allocated will satisfy the minimum allocation
gatewMay requirements set forth in the Plan and will not exceed the limits imposed by Code section 415.
Minimum Allocation Gateway – The Plan will satisfy the minimum allocation gateway by reallocating preliminary
contributions or hypothetical contributions made to Highly Compensated Employees to non-Highly Compensated
Employees so that the allocation to each non-Highly Compensated Employee equals the lesser of 1) the amount
determined by reallocating contributions allocated to Highly Compensated Employees to non-Highly Compensated
Employees so that the allocation to each non-Highly Compensated Employee equals at least one-third of the
allocation rate of the highest compensated Highly Compensated Employee with the highest allocation rate in the
manner as described in Plan Section 3.04(B)(10)(b) or 2) the amount determined by reallocating contributions
allocated to Highly Compensated Employees to non-Highly Compensated Employees so that the allocation to each
Anon-Highly Compensated Employee equals at least five percent of the non-Highly Compensated Employee’s
Compensation (if the definition of Compensation is not within the meaning of Compensation as described in Part A of
the definition of Compensation in the Plan’s Definition section, a definition which is within the meaning of
Compensation as described in Part A of the definition of Compensation in the Plan’s Definition section will apply) in
the manner as described in Plan Section 3.04(B)(10)(c).
b. Age and/or Service Weighted Formula – If the Employer has selected the age and/or service weighted allocation method in
the Adoption Agreement the allocation will be made based on the formula specified in the Adoption Agreement.
S
A Qualifying Participant will not be considered to have accrued an Employer Profit Sharing Contribution until the allocation meets
the requirements under Code section 401(a)(4) and its associated regulations. If a new comparability allocation formula is elected in
the Adoption Agreement, the allocation may satisfy the general test of Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(4)-2 either on a benefits
or a contribution basis.
8. Minimum Allocation Requirements for Employer Profit Sharing Contributions Tested on a Benefits Basis – The Employer may, at
its discretion, choose to test the allocation of Employer Profit Sharing Contributions elected in the Adoption Agreement using
the general test of Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(4)-2 on either a benefits or a contribution basis. An Adopting Employer that
tests an Employer Profit Sharing Contribution on a benefits basis must satisfy the allocation requirements in one of items a, b, or
c below. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, for the purposes of the preceding sentence, an Adopting
Employer must satisfy the allocation requirements in item (c) so that the allocation to each non-Highly Compensated Employee
equals the lesser of the amounts described in items (c)(i) and (c)(ii) below.
a. Broadly Available Allocation Rates – The Plan must provide an allocation that uses broadly available allocation rates. The
Plan will have broadly available allocation rates for the Plan Year if each allocation rate under the Plan is currently available
during the Plan Year to a group of Employees that satisfies the requirements under Code section 410(b) (without regard to
the average benefit percentage test of Treasury Regulation section 1.410(b)-5) and as otherwise specified in Treasury
Regulation section 1.401(a)(4)-8(b)(1)(iii).
b. Gradually Increasing Allocation Formula – The Plan must provide an allocation based on the age and/or service allocation
formula in the Adoption Agreement that satisfies the requirements to be gradually increasing age and/or service formula
under Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(4)-8(b)(1)(iv).

c. Minimum Allocation Gateway – The Plan must provide a benefit under the allocation method selected in the Adoption
Agreement that satisfies one of the following minimum allocation gateway tests by making the appropriate selections in
the Adoption Agreement, if applicable.
The Plan satisfies a minimum allocation gateway for a plan that is not a combination of permissively aggregated defined
contribution and defined benefit plans if it otherwise satisfies Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(4)-8(b)(1)(vi). The Plan
will satisfy such gateway if it meets one of the two following formulas. E
i. One-Third Approach – Each non-Highly Compensated Employee who is eligible to participate has an allocation rate
that is at least one-third of the allocation rate of the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest allocation rate.
For purposes of determining this allocation rate, such allocation rate will equal the quotient of the Employer Profit
Sharing Contribution allocated to a Participant divided by the Participant’s Compensation.
If a selection is made in the Adoption Agreement to satisfy a minimum allocation gateway and to reallocate
hypothetical contributions from Highly Compensated EmLployees to non-Highly Compensated Employees in order to
provide each non-Highly Compensated Employee with an allocation rate that is equal to at least one-third of the
allocation rate of the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest allocation rate, then, to the extent necessary,
the following steps will be taken.
A. Identify the Employees of the Employer who participate in the Plan who are non-Highly Compensated Employees
of such Employer and arrange them in order of their allocation rates from the highest to the lowest.
P
B. Identify the Highly Compensated Employees of the Employer who participate in the Plan and arrange them in
order of their allocation rates from the highest to the lowest.
C. As of the date of allocation, lower the allocation to the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest
allocation rate determined in (B) above. The reduction will equal the lesser of 1) the amount necessary so that the
non-Highly Compensated Employee with the lowest allocation rate receives an allocation equal to one-third of
the allocation rate of the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest allocation rate, or 2) the amount which
wMould cause such Highly Compensated Employee’s allocation rate to equal the allocation rate of the Highly
Compensated Employee with the next highest allocation rate. As of the date of allocation, that reduction will be
added to the Individual Account of the non-Highly Compensated Employee described in 1) above.
D. Repeat the procedures in (C) above until all non-Highly Compensated Employees have an allocation rate equal to
at least one-third of the allocation rate of the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest allocation rate. If
the allocation rate of a Highly Compensated Employee is lowered under (C) above or this clause (D) to the point
where it is equal to that of the Highly Compensated Employees with the next highest allocation rate, then any
further reductions in allocations will be apportioned between the former and latter Highly Compensated
Employees in a manner that causes their equivalent allocation rates to be reduced by the same amount.
A
E. Participants whose sole allocation for a Plan Year consists of either a minimum allocation made pursuant to Plan
Section 3.04(E) or a Safe Harbor Nonelective Contribution are considered benefiting for purposes of the
minimum allocation gateway. Allocation rates will include such contributions when determining whether the
minimum gateway allocation has been satisfied.
ii. Five-Percent Approach – Each non-Highly Compensated Employee who is eligible to participate receives an allocation
of at least five-percent of such Employee’s Compensation, as defined in Part A of the definition of Compensation in
Sthe Plan’s Definition section, for the period during which the non-Highly Compensated Employee is eligible to receive
an allocation under this section.
If a selection is made in the Adoption Agreement to satisfy a minimum allocation gateway under new comparability
and to reallocate hypothetical contributions from Highly Compensated Employees to non-Highly Compensated
Employees in order to provide each non-Highly Compensated Employee with an allocation of at least five-percent of
such Employee’s Compensation, as defined in Part A of the definition of Compensation in the Plan’s Definition section,
for the period during which the non-Highly Compensated Employee is eligible to receive an allocation under this
section, then, to the extent necessary, the following steps will be taken.
A. Identify the Employees of the Employer who participate in the Plan who are non-Highly Compensated Employees of
such Employer, and arrange them in order of their allocation rates from the highest to the lowest.
B. Identify the Highly Compensated Employees of the Employer who participate in the Plan, and arrange them in
order of their allocation rates from the highest to the lowest.
C. As of the date of allocation, lower the allocation to the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest
allocation rate determined in (B) above. The reduction will equal the lesser of 1) the amount necessary so that the
non-Highly Compensated Employee with the lowest allocation rate receives an allocation equal to five-percent of
such Employee’s Compensation, as defined in Part A of the definition of Compensation in the Plan’s Definition
section, for the period during which the non-Highly Compensated Employee is eligible to receive an allocation
under this section, or 2) the amount that would cause such Highly Compensated Employee’s allocation rate to
equal the allocation rate of the Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest allocation rate. As of the
date of allocation, that reduction will be added to the Individual Account of the non-Highly Compensated
Employee described in 1) above.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 33 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 39]
D. Repeat the procedures in (C) above until each of the non-Highly Compensated Employees have an allocation rate
equal to at least five-percent of such Employee’s Compensation, as defined in Part A of the definition of
Compensation in the Plan’s Definition section, for the period during which the each of the non-Highly
Compensated Employees are eligible to receive an allocation under this section. If the allocation rate of a Highly
Compensated Employee is lowered under (C) above or this clause (D) to the point where it is equal to that of the
Highly Compensated Employees with the next highest allocation rate, then any further reductions in allocations
E
will be apportioned between the former and latter Highly Compensated Employees in a manner that causes their
equivalent allocation rates to be reduced by the same amount.
E. If the allocation rate of the Highly Compensated Employees is less than five-percent, either before any
reallocation pursuant to this Plan Section 3.04(B)(10)(c), or as a result of any reallocation pursuant to this Plan
Section 3.04(B)(10)(c), then for that Plan Year, the Employer Profit Sharing Contributions will be allocated as if the
Employer had elected a pro rata allocation formula (as described in Adoption Agreement Section Three).
L
F. Participants whose sole allocation for a Plan Year consists of either a minimum allocation made pursuant to Plan
Section 3.04(E) or a Safe Harbor Nonelective Contribution, are considered benefiting for purposes of the
minimum allocation gateway. Allocation rates will include such contributions when determining whether the
minimum gateway allocation has been satisfied.
The Employer must make additional contributions to a Participant who is a non-Highly Compensated Employee and who
receives only a top-heavy minimum coPntribution or a Safe Harbor Nonelective Contribution, in order to satisfy the
minimum allocation gateway. The amount of such additional contribution will be equal to the difference between the
amount required to satisfy the minimum allocation gateway and the top-heavy minimum or Safe Harbor Nonelective
Contribution received by such Employee, whichever is applicable.
If this Plan is permissively aggregated with one or more defined benefit plans, the minimum gateway allocation that is
determined pursuant to this section may be increased to the extent necessary to satisfy Treasury Regulation section
1.401(a)(4)-9(b)(2)(v)(D).
M
C. Allocation of Forfeitures – Subject to the Employer’s discretion, Forfeitures may be applied to the payment of the Plan’s
administrative expenses in accordance with Plan Section 7.04 and/or applied to the restoration of Participants’ Individual Accounts
pursuant to Plan Section 4.01(C)(3). Any remaining Forfeitures will be allocated as follows.
1. Profit Sharing Plan – Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, if this is a profit sharing plan, Forfeitures will be used
to reduce Employer Contributions. For purposes of this section, Forfeitures shall include forfeited amounts that are attributable
to a money purchase pension plan or a target benefit pension plan that was transferred to the Plan. Notwithstanding the
preceding, Forfeitures arising under Plan Section 3.12 may be allocated to Qualifying Participants in accordance with Plan
Section 3.04(B).
A2. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan – Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, if this is a 401(k) profit sharing plan, Forfeitures
of Employer Profit Sharing Contributions, Matching Contributions, ACP Test Safe Harbor Matching Contributions, Excess
Aggregate Contributions, QACA ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions, and QACA ACP Test Safe Harbor Matching Contributions
will be used to reduce Employer Contributions other than Elective Deferrals. For purposes of this section, Forfeitures shall include
forfeited amounts that are attributable to a money purchase pension plan or a target benefit pension plan that was transferred
to the Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, Forfeitures arising under Plan Section 3.12 may be allocated to Qualifying
Participants in accordance with Plan Section 3.04(B).
S
3. Money Purchase Pension Plan – Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, if this Plan is a money purchase pension
plan, Forfeitures will be used to reduce Employer Money Purchase Pension Contributions to the Plan. Notwithstanding the
preceding, Forfeitures arising under Plan Section 3.12 may be allocated to Qualifying Participants in accordance with Plan
Section 3.04(B).
Forfeitures must be applied for the Plan Year in which the Forfeitures arose or for the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the
Forfeiture arose. Notwithstanding the preceding, Forfeitures must be applied in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner if applied
either to the payment of the Plan’s administrative expenses or to the restoration of Participants’ Individual Accounts pursuant to Plan
Section 4.01(C)(3). Forfeitures that are reallocated to Participants’ Individual Accounts need not be reallocated to the same
contribution source from which they were forfeited. In addition, Forfeitures may be applied in accordance with any permissible
method set forth in this section upon the termination of the Plan.
D. Timing of Employer Contribution – Unless otherwise specified in the Plan or permitted by law or regulation, the Employer Contribution
made by an Employer for each Plan Year will be deposited with the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) not later than the due date for
filing the Employer’s income tax return for its tax year in which the Plan Year ends, including extensions thereof. Notwithstanding the
preceding, Employer Contributions may be deposited during the Plan Year for which they are being made.
E. Minimum Allocation for Top-Heavy Plans – The contribution and allocation provisions of this Plan Section 3.04(E) will apply for any
Plan Year with respect to which this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan and will supersede any conflicting provisions in the Plan or Adoption
Agreement.
1. Except as otherwise provided in (3) and (4) below, the Employer Contributions and Forfeitures allocated on behalf of any Participant
who is not a Key Employee will not be less than the lesser of three-percent of such Participant’s Compensation or (in the case where
the Employer does not maintain a defined benefit plan in addition to this Plan that designates this Plan to satisfy Code section 401)
the largest percentage of Employer Contributions and Forfeitures, as a percentage of the Key Employee’s Compensation, as limited
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 34 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 40]
by Code section 401(a)(17), allocated on behalf of any Key Employee for that year. The minimum allocation is determined without
regard to any Social Security contribution. Unless the Adopting Employer, in the Adoption Agreement, elects to allocate a top-heavy
contribution to Participants who are Key Employees, only Participants who are not Key Employees will be entitled to receive the
minimum allocation. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Employer maintains a defined benefit plan in addition to this Plan and
specifies in the Adoption Agreement that the minimum allocation will be made to this Plan, then except as provided in (3) and (4)
below, Employer Contributions and Forfeitures allocated on behalf of any Participant who is not a Key Employee will not be less than
E
five-percent of such Participant’s Compensation. For purposes of the preceding sentences, the largest percentage of Employer
Contributions and Forfeitures as a percentage of each Key Employee’s Compensation will be determined by treating Elective
Deferrals as Employer Contributions. This minimum allocation will be made even though under other Plan provisions, the Participant
would not otherwise be entitled to receive an allocation, or would have received a lesser allocation for the year because of 1) the
Participant’s failure to complete 1,000 Hours of Service (or any comparable period provided in the Plan), or 2) the Participant’s failure
to make mandatory Nondeductible Employee Contributions to the Plan, or 3) had Compensation less than a stated amount.
2. For purposes of computing the minimum allocation, CompensationL will mean compensation as provided in the Definitions
section of the Plan as limited by Code section 401(a)(17) and will include any amounts contributed by the Employer pursuant to
a salary reduction agreement and that is not includible in gross income under Code sections 402(g), 125, 132(f)(4), or 457.
Compensation for the full Determination Year will be used in calculating the minimum allocation.
3. The provision in (1) above will not apply to any Participant who was not employed by the Employer on the last day of the Plan
Year. In addition, the provision in (1) above will not apply to any Employee included in a unit of Employees covered by an
agreement which the Secretary of Labor findPs to be a collective bargaining agreement between the Employer and Employee
representatives if there is evidence that retirement benefits were the subject of good faith bargaining between such Employee
representatives and the Employer.
4. The provision in (1) above will not apply to any Participant to the extent the Participant is covered under any other plan or plans
of the Employer and the Adopting Employer has provided in the Adoption Agreement that the minimum allocation or benefit
requirement applicable to Top-Heavy Plans will be met in the other plan or plans and the participant received the minimum
allocation or benefit under such plan or plans.
M
5. The minimum allocation required for purposes of this Plan Section 3.04(E) must be nonforfeitable to the extent required under
Code section 416(b)(1)(A) or (b)(1)(B).
6. Elective Deferrals (and for Plan Years beginning before 2002, Matching Contributions) may not be taken into account for
purposes of satisfying the minimum allocation requirement applicable to Top-Heavy Plans described in Plan Section 3.04(E)(1).
Qualified Nonelective Contributions may, however, be taken into account for such purposes.
7. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, the top-heavy minimum will offset Employer Profit Sharing Contributions,
if any.
F. AReturn of the Employer Contribution to the Employer Under Special Circumstances – Any contribution made by the Employer
because of a mistake of fact must be returned to the Employer within one year of the contribution.
In the event that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determines that the Plan is not initially qualified under the Code, any
contributions made incident to that initial qualification by the Employer must be returned to the Employer within one year after the date
the initial qualification is denied, but only if the application for qualification is made by the time prescribed by law for filing the Employer’s
return for the taxable year in which the Plan is adopted, or such later date as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe.
SIn the event that a contribution made by the Employer under this Plan is conditioned on deductibility and is not deductible under
Code section 404, the contribution, to the extent of the amount disallowed, must be returned to the Employer within one year after
the deduction is disallowed.
If applicable, no contract will be purchased under the Plan unless such contract or a separate definite written agreement between the
Employer and the insurer provides that no value under contracts providing benefits under the Plan or credits determined by the
insurer (on account of dividends, earnings, or other experience rating credits, or surrender or cancellation credits) with respect to such
contracts may be paid or returned to the Employer or diverted to or used for other than the exclusive benefit of the Participants or
their Beneficiaries. However, any contribution made by the Employer because of a mistake of fact must be returned to the Employer
within one year of the contribution.
G. One-Time Irrevocable Participant Elections
This Plan section 3.04(G) applies if the Adopting Employer has indicated in the Adoption Agreement that an Employee may make a
one-time irrevocable election to have the Employer make contributions to the Plan on such Employee’s behalf. In such event, an
Employee may elect, upon the Employee’s first becoming eligible to participate in the Plan, to have contributions equal to a specified
amount or percentage (including no amount or percentage) of the Employee’s potential Compensation made by the Employer on the
Employee’s behalf to the Plan (and to any other plan of the employer) for the duration of the Employee’s employment with the
Employer. Any contributions made pursuant to a one-time irrevocable election described in this Section 3.04(G) and in accordance
with Treasury Regulation section 1.401(k)-1(a)(3)(v) are not treated as made pursuant to a cash or deferred election, are not elective
Deferrals and are not includible in an Employee’s Compensation. Such contributions shall be treated as Employer Profit Sharing
Contributions.

3.05 QUALIFIED NONELECTIVE CONTRIBUTIONS
The Employer may make Qualified Nonelective Contributions under the Plan if elected in the Adoption Agreement. The amount of such
contribution, if any, to the Plan for each Plan Year, will be determined by the Employer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
Plan, the Employer may make Qualified Nonelective Contributions to the Plan in the amount necessary to satisfy testing requirements.
Qualified Nonelective Contributions Used to Satisfy Testing Requirements – If the current-year testing rules apply to the Plan, in
E
lieu of distributing Excess Contributions or Excess Aggregate Contributions as provided in Plan Sections 5.13 and 5.14, the Employer
may, if permitted in the Adoption Agreement, use all or any portion of the Qualified Nonelective Contributions to satisfy either the
Actual Deferral Percentage test, the Actual Contribution Percentage test, or both. The option to use all or any portion of the Qualified
Nonelective Contributions to satisfy either the Actual Deferral Percentage test or the Actual Contribution Percentage test is not
available if prior-year testing rules apply to the Plan.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, and in addition to, or in lieu of, the allocation formula selected in the Adoption
Agreement, Qualified Nonelective Contributions may be allocated to the Individual Accounts of a group of non-Highly Compensated
L
Employees selected by the Employer and who are eligible Participants, following the requirements under Treasury Regulation section
1.401(k) and 1.401(m) (including the permissive disaggregation rules) for purpose of satisfying the Actual Deferral Percentage test, the
Actual Contribution Percentage test, or both. No allocation will be required in excess of the amount required to satisfy the Actual Deferral
Percentage test, the Actual Contribution Percentage test, or both. Qualified Nonelective Contributions may be made during the Plan Year
for which they are being made; however, the Employer must follow the allocation requirements set forth below and unless specified
otherwise in the Adoption Agreement, must adhere to the eligibility requirements applicable to Elective Deferrals, including a forfeiture of
allocations where such eligibility requirements are Pnot satisfied.
For Plan Years beginning in 2006 (or such earlier date on which the final regulations under Treasury Regulation section 1.401(k) and
1.401(m) became effective), Qualified Nonelective Contributions taken into account under the Actual Deferral Percentage (ADP) test
cannot exceed the product of the non-Highly Compensated Employee’s Compensation and the greater of 1) five-percent (ten-
percent if the Qualified Nonelective Contribution is made in connection with an Employer’s obligation to pay prevailing wages under
the Davis-Bacon Act plan), or 2) two times the Plan’s representative contribution rate. The “representative contribution rate,” for this
purpose, is the lowest applicable contribution rate of any eligible non-Highly Compensated Employee among a group of eligible non-
M
Highly Compensated Employees that consists of one-half of all non-Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year (or if greater,
the lowest applicable percentage contribution rate of any eligible non-Highly Compensated Employee in the group of all eligible
non-Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year and who is employed by the Employer on the last day of the Plan Year). The
“applicable contribution rate” for these purposes is the sum of the Qualified Matching Contributions taken into account for the ADP
test for the eligible non-Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year and the Qualified Nonelective Contributions made for the
eligible non-Highly Compensated Employee for the Plan Year, divided by the eligible non-Highly Compensated Employee’s
Compensation for the same period.
3.06 QUALIFIED MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS
TheA Employer may make Qualified Matching Contributions under the Plan if elected in the Adoption Agreement. If the current-year testing
rules apply to the Plan and the Employer has so elected in the Adoption Agreement, in lieu of distributing Excess Contributions or Excess
Aggregate Contributions as provided in Plan Sections 5.13 and 5.14, the Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to use Qualified
Matching Contributions to satisfy either the Actual Deferral Percentage test, the Actual Contribution Percentage test, or both, pursuant to
Treasury Regulations under Code sections 401(k) and 401(m). The option to use all or any portion of the Qualified Matching Contributions
to satisfy either the Actual Deferral Percentage test or the Actual Contribution Percentage test is not available if prior-year testing rules
apply to the Plan.
SUnless another allocation formula is specified in the Adoption Agreement, Qualified Matching Contributions, if made, will be in an amount
equal to that percentage of the Elective Deferrals (and Nondeductible Employee Contributions) of each non-Highly Compensated
Employee that would be sufficient to cause the Plan to satisfy the Actual Contribution Percentage test, the Actual Deferral Percentage test,
or both. For Plan Years beginning in 2006 (or such earlier date on which the final regulations under Treasury Regulation section 1.401(k)
and 1.401(m) became effective), if Qualified Matching Contributions exceed 100 percent of a Qualifying Contributing Participant’s Elective
Deferrals, the additional ACP testing restrictions listed in Plan Section 3.02 will apply.
If elected in the Adoption Agreement, the Employer may make Qualified Matching Contributions under the Plan on behalf of Qualifying
Contributing Participants. To be a Qualifying Contributing Participant for a Plan Year, the Participant must make Elective Deferrals (or
Nondeductible Employee Contributions, if the Employer has agreed to match such contributions) for the Plan Year and satisfy any age and
eligibility service and other requirements that are specified for Qualified Matching Contributions in the Adoption Agreement. If the
Employer makes Qualified Matching Contributions to the Plan based on Compensation earned and Elective Deferrals (or Nondeductible
Employee Contributions) made during a portion of the Matching Contribution Computation Period (e.g., on a payroll basis when the
Matching Contribution Computation Period is Plan Year), the Employer shall re-calculate (“true-up”) the Qualified Matching Contribution
based on the Compensation earned and Elective Deferrals (or Nondeductible Employee Contributions) made over the Matching
Contribution Computation Period. Such true-up shall be made in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 36 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 42]
3.07 ROLLOVER CONTRIBUTIONS
Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, an Employee may make Indirect Rollover and Direct Rollover contributions to the
Plan from distributions made from plans described in Code sections 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408, and 457(b) (if maintained by a
governmental entity) (excluding nondeductible employee contributions and Roth elective deferrals except as otherwise indicated in the
Adoption Agreement) unless an Employee is either an Employee of a Related Employer of the Adopting Employer that does not participate
in this Plan or a member of any excluded class in Adoption Agreement Section Two and Plan SeEction 2.01. The Plan Administrator may
require the Employee to certify, either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL, that the
contribution qualifies as a rollover contribution under the applicable provisions of the Code. If it is later determined that all or part of a
rollover contribution was ineligible to be contributed to the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall direct that any ineligible amounts, plus
earnings or losses attributable thereto (determined in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B)), be distributed from the Plan to the
Employee as soon as administratively feasible.
A separate account will be maintained by the Plan Administrator for each Employee’s rollover contributions, which will be nonforfeitable at all
times. Such account will share in the income and gains and losses of the Fund iLn the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B). Where the
Adoption Agreement does not permit Employer designation with respect to rollover contributions, the Employer may, in a uniform and
nondiscriminatory manner, allow only Employees who have become Participants in the Plan to make rollover contributions. However, if the
Employer permits Employees who have not become Participants in the Plan and/or former Employees to maintain rollover contributions in the
Plan, such individuals will be treated as Participants for purposes of those assets, but they may not receive a loan from the Fund.
3.08 TRANSFER CONTRIBUTIONS
P
The Adopting Employer may, subject to uniform and nondiscriminatory rules, permit elective transfers to be delivered to the Trustee (or
Custodian, if applicable) in the name of an Employee from the trustee or custodian of another plan qualified under Code section 401(a).
Whether any particular elective transfer will be accepted by the Plan will be determined using the uniform and nondiscriminatory rules
established by the Plan Administrator, and the procedures for the receipt of such transfers by the Plan must be allowed under Code section
411(d)(6), Treasury Regulation section 1.411(d)-4, and other rules promulgated by the IRS. Nothing in this Plan prohibits the Plan Administrator
from permitting (or prohibiting) Participants to transfer their Individual Accounts to other eligible plans, provided such transfers are permitted
(or prohibited) in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. If it is later determined that all or part of an elective transfer was ineligible to be
transferred into the Plan, thMe Plan Administrator shall direct that any ineligible amounts, plus earnings or losses attributable thereto
(determined in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B)), be distributed from the Plan to the Employee as soon as administratively
feasible. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Employer may, at its discretion, also return the amount transferred to the transferor plan or
correct the ineligible transfer using any other method permitted by the IRS under regulation or other guidance.
A separate account will be maintained by the Plan Administrator for each Employee’s elective transfers, which will, if applicable, be
nonforfeitable at all times. Such account will share in the income and gains and losses of the Fund in the manner described in Plan Section
7.02(B). Notwithstanding the preceding, an Employee’s separate account established solely on account of an event described in Code
section 414(l) will continue to be subject to the Plan’s vesting schedule except as otherwise provided therein. If elective transfers are
associated with distributable events and the Employees are eligible to receive single sum distributions consisting entirely of Eligible
A
Rollover Contributions, the elective transfers will be considered Direct Rollovers.
3.09 DEDUCTIBLE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS
The Plan Administrator will not accept Deductible Employee Contributions that are made for a taxable year beginning after December 31,
1986. Contributions made before that date will be maintained in a separate account, which will be nonforfeitable at all times. The account will
share in the gains and losses of the Fund in the same manner as described in Plan Section 7.02(B). No part of the Deductible Employee
Contributions account will be used to purchase life insurance. Subject to Plan Section 5.10 (if applicable), the Participant may withdraw any part
Sof the Deductible Employee Contribution account by making a written application to the Plan Administrator.
3.10 NONDEDUCTIBLE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS
If the Adopting Employer so allows in the Adoption Agreement, a Participant may contribute Nondeductible Employee Contributions to the
Plan by enrolling as a Contributing Participant pursuant to the applicable provisions of Plan Section 3.01. The Employer will establish uniform
and nondiscriminatory rules and procedures for Nondeductible Employee Contributions as it deems necessary and advisable including, but not
limited to, rules describing any amounts or percentages of Compensation that Participants may or must contribute to the Plan. Nondeductible
Employee Contributions for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 1986, together with any Matching Contributions, will be limited so as to
satisfy the Actual Contribution Percentage test in Plan Section 3.14. Notwithstanding the preceding, contributions made to the Plan on an
after-tax basis (e.g., to repay defaulted loans or to buy back previously forfeited amounts as described in Plan Section 4.01(C)(3)) do not
constitute Nondeductible Employee Contributions and will not, therefore, be subject to the nondiscrimination test of Code section 401(m) or
the Annual Additions limits of Code section 415.
A separate account will be maintained by the Plan Administrator for the Nondeductible Employee Contributions of each Participant.
3.11 OTHER LIMITATIONS ON SIMPLE 401(K) CONTRIBUTIONS
If the Employer has established a SIMPLE 401(k) Plan, no Employer or Employee contributions may be made to this Plan for the SIMPLE
401(k) Year other than Elective Deferrals described in Plan Section 3.01(I), Matching or nonelective contributions described in Plan Section
3.02, and rollover contributions described in Plan Section 3.07.

[PAGE 43]
3.12 LIMITATION ON ALLOCATIONS
A. If the Participant does not participate in, and has never participated in, another qualified plan maintained by the Employer, a welfare
benefit fund (as defined in Code section 419(e)) maintained by the Employer, an individual medical account (as defined in Code section
415(l)(2)) maintained by the Employer, or a simplified employee pension plan (as defined in Code section 408(k)) maintained by the
Employer, any of which provides an Annual Addition as defined in the Definitions section of the Plan, the following rules will apply.
E
1. The amount of Annual Additions that may be credited to the Participant’s Individual Account for any Limitation Year will not
exceed the lesser of the Maximum Permissible Amount or any other limitation contained in this Plan. If the Employer
Contribution that would otherwise be contributed or allocated to the Participant’s Individual Account would cause the Annual
Additions for the Limitation Year to exceed the Maximum Permissible Amount, the amount contributed or allocated may be
reduced so that the Annual Additions for the Limitation Year will equal the Maximum Permissible Amount.
2. Before determining the Participant’s actual Compensation for the Limitation Year, the Employer may determine the Maximum
Permissible Amount for a Participant on the basis of a reasonable eLstimate of the Participant’s Compensation for the Limitation
Year, uniformly determined for all Participants similarly situated.
3. As soon as is administratively feasible after the end of the Limitation Year, the Maximum Permissible Amount for the Limitation
Year will be determined on the basis of the Participant’s actual Compensation for the Limitation Year.
B. If, in addition to this Plan, the Participant is covered under another qualified pre-approved defined contribution plan maintained by
the Employer, a welfare benefit fund maintained Pby the Employer, an individual medical account maintained by the Employer, or a
simplified employee pension plan maintained by the Employer any of which provides an Annual Addition as defined in the Definitions
section of the Plan during any Limitation Year, the following rules apply.
1. The Annual Additions that may be credited to a Participant’s Individual Account under this Plan for any such Limitation Year will not
exceed the Maximum Permissible Amount, reduced by the Annual Additions credited to a Participant under the other qualified Pre-
approved Plans, welfare benefit funds, individual medical account, and simplified employee pension plans for the same Limitation
Year. If the Annual Additions with respect to the Participant under other qualified Pre-approved defined contribution plans, welfare
benefit funds, inMdividual medical accounts, and simplified employee pension plans maintained by the Employer are less than the
Maximum Permissible Amount, and the Employer Contribution that would otherwise be contributed or allocated to the Participant’s
Individual Account under this Plan would cause the Annual Additions for the Limitation Year to exceed this limitation, the amount
contributed or allocated may be reduced so that the Annual Additions under all such plans and funds for the Limitation Year will
equal the Maximum Permissible Amount. If the Annual Additions with respect to the Participant under such other qualified Pre-
approved defined contribution plans, welfare benefit funds, individual medical accounts, and simplified employee pension plans in
the aggregate are equal to or greater than the Maximum Permissible Amount, no amount will be contributed or allocated to the
Participant’s Individual Account under this Plan for the Limitation Year.
2. Before determining the Participant’s actual Compensation for the Limitation Year, the Employer may determine the Maximum
A
Permissible Amount for a Participant in the manner described in Plan Section 3.12(A)(2).
3. As soon as is administratively feasible after the end of the Limitation Year, the Maximum Permissible Amount for the Limitation
Year will be determined on the basis of the Participant’s actual Compensation for the Limitation Year.
4. Any Excess Annual Additions attributed to this Plan will be disposed of in the manner described in Plan Section 7.11.
5. If the Participant is covered under another qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the Employer, other than a Pre-
approved Plan, the provisions of Plan Section 3.12(B)(1) through 3.12(B)(4) will apply as if the other plan were a Pre-approved
S
Plan. In the event this method cannot be administered because of conflicting language in the other plan, the Employer must
provide, through a written attachment to the Plan, the method under which the plans will limit total Annual Additions to the
Maximum Permissible Amount, and will properly reduce any Excess Annual Additions in a manner that precludes Employer
discretion.
C. The provisions of this Plan Section 3.12 will apply to SIMPLE 401(k) contributions made pursuant to Plan Sections 3.01(I) and 3.02.
D. Adoption Agreement elections to include or exclude items from Compensation that are inconsistent with Code section 415 and the
corresponding regulations will be disregarded for purposes of determining a Participant’s Annual Additions limit.
3.13 ACTUAL DEFERRAL PERCENTAGE TEST (ADP)
A. Limits on Highly Compensated Employees – The Actual Deferral Percentage (hereinafter “ADP”) for a Plan Year for Participants who
are Highly Compensated Employees for each Plan Year and the ADP for Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees for
the same Plan Year must satisfy one of the following tests.
1. The ADP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the ADP for Participants who
are non-Highly Compensated Employees for the same Plan Year multiplied by 1.25; or
2. The ADP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the ADP for Participants who
are non-Highly Compensated Employees for the same Plan Year multiplied by 2.0 provided that the ADP for Participants who are
Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed the ADP for Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees by
more than two percentage points.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 38 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 44]
The Plan must satisfy the ADP test using either the prior-year testing or current-year testing requirements described below.
Notwithstanding the preceding, and unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, the prior-year testing method
described below will apply to this Plan.
3. Prior-Year Testing – The ADP for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for each Plan Year and the
prior year’s ADP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated Employees for the prior Plan Year must satisfy one of the
following tests. E
a. The ADP for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the prior
year’s ADP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated Employees for the prior Plan Year multiplied by 1.25; or
b. The ADP for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the prior
year’s ADP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated Employees for the prior Plan Year multiplied by 2.0,
provided that the ADP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed the ADP for Participants
who were non-Highly Compensated Employees in the prior PLlan Year by more than two percentage points.
For the first Plan Year that the Plan permits any Participant to make Elective Deferrals (and this is not a successor Plan), for
purposes of the preceding tests, the prior year’s non-Highly Compensated Employees’ ADP will be three-percent unless the
Adopting Employer has elected in the Adoption Agreement to use the actual Plan Year’s ADP for these Participants.
Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Adopting Employer has elected the Safe Harbor CODA or the QACA option in the
Adoption Agreement, the current-year testinPg provisions described in Plan Section 3.13(A)(4) will apply. In addition, if the
Adopting Employer has elected the Safe Harbor CODA or the QACA option in the Adoption Agreement and the Adoption
Agreement does not permit the Employer to designation the ADP testing method, the current-year testing provisions described
in Plan Section 3.13(A)(4) will apply.
4. Current-Year Testing – If elected by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement, the ADP tests in this Plan Section 3.13(A)(1) and
(2) above will be applied by comparing the current Plan Year’s ADP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees
with the current Plan Year’s ADP for Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees. Once a current-year testing
election is madeM, the Employer can elect prior-year testing for a Plan Year only if the Plan has used current-year testing for each
of the preceding five Plan Years (or if less, the number of Plan Years the Plan has been in existence) or if, as a result of a merger
or acquisition described in Code section 410(b)(6)(C)(i), the Employer maintains both a plan using prior-year testing and a plan
using current-year testing and the change is made within the transition period described in Code section 410(b)(6)(C)(ii).
Notwithstanding the preceding, the Plan will be treated as meeting the ADP test if, within a reasonable period before any Plan Year,
each Participant eligible to participate is given a notice (either in writing or in any other form permitted by Treasury Regulations or
other rules promulgated by the IRS) that satisfies the requirements of Code section 401(k)(12)(D), and the Employer makes ADP Test
Safe Harbor Contributions pursuant to Code sections 401(k)(12)(B) and (C), respectively.
B. ASpecial Rules
1. A Participant is a Highly Compensated Employee for a particular Plan Year if they meet the definition of a Highly Compensated
Employee in effect for that Plan Year. Similarly, a Participant is a non-Highly Compensated Employee for a particular Plan Year if
they do not meet the definition of a Highly Compensated Employee in effect for that Plan Year.
2. The ADP for any Participant who is a Highly Compensated Employee for the Plan Year and who is eligible to have Elective
Deferrals (and Qualified Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions, or both, if treated as Elective Deferrals
for purposes of the ADP test) allocated to their Individual Accounts under two or more arrangements described in Code section
S
401(k) that are maintained by the Employer, will be determined as if such Elective Deferrals (and, if applicable, such Qualified
Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions, or both) were made under a single arrangement. If a Highly
Compensated Employee participates in two or more cash or deferred arrangements that have different Plan Years, all Elective
Deferrals made during the Plan Year under all such arrangements will be aggregated. Certain plans will be treated as separate if
mandatorily disaggregated under the Treasury Regulations under Code section 401(k).
3. In the event that this Plan satisfies the requirements of Code sections 401(k), 401(a)(4), or 410(b) only if aggregated with one or
more other plans, or if one or more other plans satisfy the requirements of such Code sections only if aggregated with this Plan,
then this Plan Section 3.13(B)(3) will be applied by determining the ADP of Participants as if all such plans were a single plan. If
more than ten-percent of the Employer’s non-Highly Compensated Employees are involved in a plan coverage change as
defined in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(k)-2(c)(4), then any adjustments to the non-Highly Compensated Employee ADP for
the prior year will be made in accordance with such regulations, unless the Adopting Employer has elected in the Adoption
Agreement to use the current-year testing method. Plans may be aggregated in order to satisfy Code section 401(k) only if they
have the same Plan Year and use the same ADP testing method.
4. For purposes of satisfying the ADP test, Elective Deferrals, Qualified Nonelective Contributions, and Qualified Matching Contributions
must be made before the end of the 12-month period immediately following the Plan Year to which contributions relate.
5. The Employer shall maintain records sufficient to demonstrate satisfaction of the ADP test and the amount of Qualified
Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions, or both, used in such test.
6. The determination and treatment of the ADP amounts of any Participant will satisfy such other requirements as may be
prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 39 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 45]
7. If the Employer elects to take Qualified Matching Contributions into account as Elective Deferrals for purposes of the ADP test,
then (subject to such other requirements as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) the Employer may elect, in a
uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, to either include all Qualified Matching Contributions in the ADP test or to include only
the amount of such Qualified Matching Contributions that are needed to meet the ADP test.
8. In the event that the Plan Administrator determines that it is not likely that the ADP test will be satisfied for a particular Plan Year
unless certain steps are taken before the end of such Plan Year, the Plan Administrator mEay require Contributing Participants who
are Highly Compensated Employees to reduce or cease future Elective Deferrals for such Plan Year in order to satisfy that
requirement. This limitation will be considered a Plan-imposed limit for Catch-up Contribution purposes. If the Plan Administrator
requires Contributing Participants to reduce or cease making Elective Deferrals under this paragraph, the reduction or cessation will
begin with the Highly Compensated Employee with either the largest amount of Elective Deferrals or the highest Contribution
Percentage for the Plan Year (on the date on which it is determined that the ADP test will not likely be satisfied), as elected by the
Plan Administrator. All remaining Highly Compensated Employees’ Elective Deferrals for the Plan Year will be limited to such
amount. Notwithstanding the preceding, if it is later determined thatL the ADP test for the Plan Year will be satisfied, Highly
Compensated Employees will be permitted to enroll again as Contributing Participants in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
9. Elective Deferrals that are treated as Catch-up Contributions because they exceed a Plan limit or a statutory limit will be
excluded from ADP testing. Amounts which are characterized as Catch–up Contributions as a result of the ADP test will reduce
the amount of Excess Contributions distributed or Qualified Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions
contributed to the Plan to correct an Excess Contribution.
P
10. Special Rule for Early Participation – If the Plan provides that Employees are eligible to become Contributing Participants before
they have completed the minimum age and service requirements in Code section 410(a)(1)(A), and if the Plan applies Code
section 410(b)(4)(B) in determining whether the Plan satisfies the requirements in Code section 410(b)(1), then in determining
whether the Plan satisfies the ADP test, either:
a. pursuant to Code section 401(k)(3)(F), the ADP test is performed under the Plan (determined without regard to disaggregation
under Treasury Regulation section 1.410(b)-7(c)(3)), using the ADP for all eligible Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan
Year and thMe ADP of eligible non-Highly Compensated Employees for the applicable year, disregarding all non-Highly
Compensated Employees who have not met the minimum age and services requirements in Code section 410(a)(1)(A); or
b. pursuant to Treasury Regulation section 1.401(k)-1(b)(4), the Plan is disaggregated into separate plans and the ADP test is
performed separately for all eligible Participants who have completed the minimum age and service requirements of Code
section 410(a)(1)(A) and for all eligible Participants who have not completed the minimum age and service requirements in
Code section 410(a)(1)(A).
C. Notwithstanding the preceding, the ADP test described above is treated as satisfied for any SIMPLE 401(k) Year in which an Eligible
Employer maintains this Plan as a SIMPLE 401(k) Plan.
A
3.14 ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION PERCENTAGE TEST (ACP)
A. Limits on Highly Compensated Employees – The Actual Contribution Percentage (hereinafter “ACP”) for Participants who are Highly
Compensated Employees for each Plan Year and the ACP for Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees for the same
Plan Year must satisfy one of the following tests.
1. The ACP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the ACP for Participants who
are non-Highly Compensated Employees for the same Plan Year multiplied by 1.25.
S
2. The ACP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the ACP for Participants who
are non-Highly Compensated Employees for the same Plan Year multiplied by 2.0, provided that the ACP for the Participants
who are Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed the ACP for Participants who are non-Highly Compensated
Employees by more than two percentage points.
The Plan must satisfy the ACP test using either the prior-year testing or current-year testing requirements described below.
Notwithstanding the preceding, and unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, the prior-year testing method
described below will apply to this Plan.
3. Prior-Year Testing – The ACP for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for each Plan Year and the
prior year’s ACP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated Employees for the prior Plan Year must satisfy one of the
following tests.
a. The ACP for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the prior
year’s ACP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated Employees for the prior Plan Year multiplied by 1.25.
b. The ACP for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the prior
year’s ACP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated Employees for the prior Plan Year multiplied by 2.0,
provided that the ACP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed the ACP for Participants
who were non-Highly Compensated Employees in the prior Plan Year by more than two percentage points.
For the first Plan Year, if this Plan 1) permits any Participant to make Nondeductible Employee Contributions, 2) provides for
Matching Contributions, or 3) both, and 4) this is not a successor Plan, for purposes of the preceding tests, the prior year’s non-
Highly Compensated Employees’ ACP will be three-percent unless the Employer has elected in the Adoption Agreement to use
the Plan Year’s ACP for these Participants.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 40 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 46]
Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Adopting Employer has elected the Safe Harbor CODA or the QACA option in the
Adoption Agreement, the current-year testing provisions described in Plan Section 3.14(A)(4) will apply. In addition, if the
Adopting Employer has elected the Safe Harbor CODA or the QACA option in the Adoption Agreement and the Adoption
Agreement does not permit Employer designation with respect to the ADP testing method, the current-year testing provision in
Plan Section 3.14(A)(4) will apply.
4. Current-Year Testing – If elected by the Adopting Employer in the Adoption AgreemeEnt, the ACP tests in this Plan Section
3.14(A)(1) and (2), above, will be applied by comparing the current Plan Year’s ACP for Participants who are Highly Compensated
Employees for each Plan Year with the current Plan Year’s ACP for Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees.
Once an election to use current-year testing is made, the Employer can elect prior-year testing for a Plan Year only if the Plan
has used current-year testing for each of the preceding five Plan Years (or if lesser, the number of Plan Years the Plan has been
in existence) or if, as a result of the merger or acquisition described in Code section 410(b)(6)(C)(i), the Employer maintains both
a plan using prior-year testing and a plan using current-year testing and the change is made within the transition period
described in Code section 410(b)(6)(C)(ii). L
B. Special Rules
1. A Participant is a Highly Compensated Employee for a particular Plan Year if they meet the definition of a Highly Compensated
Employee in effect for that Plan Year. Similarly, a Participant is a non-Highly Compensated Employee for a particular Plan Year if
they do not meet the definition of a Highly Compensated Employee in effect for that Plan Year.
P
2. For purposes of this Plan Section 3.14, the Contribution Percentage for any Participant who is a Highly Compensated Employee
and who is eligible to have Contribution Percentage Amounts allocated to their Individual Account under two or more plans
described in Code section 401(a), or arrangements described in Code section 401(k) that are maintained by the Employer, will be
determined as if the total of such Contribution Percentage Amounts was made under each plan. If a Highly Compensated
Employee participates in two or more such plans or arrangements that have different plan years, all Contribution Percentage
Amounts made during the Plan Year under all such plans and arrangements will be aggregated. Certain plans will be treated as
separate if mandatorily disaggregated under regulations under Code section 401(m).
M
3. In the event that this Plan satisfies the requirements of Code sections 401(m), 401(a)(4), or 410(b) only if aggregated with one or
more other plans, or if one or more other plans satisfy the requirements of such Code sections only if aggregated with this Plan,
then this Plan Section 3.14(B)(3) will be applied by determining the Contribution Percentage of Employees as if all such plans
were a single plan. If more than ten-percent of the Employer’s non-Highly Compensated Employees are involved in a plan
coverage change as defined in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(m)-2(c)(4), then any adjustments to the non-Highly
Compensated Employee ACP for the prior year will be made in accordance with such regulations, unless the Employer has
elected in the Adoption Agreement to use the current-year testing method. Plans may be aggregated in order to satisfy Code
section 401(m) only if they have the same Plan Year and use the same ACP testing method.
4. For purposes of determining the Actual Contribution Percentage test, Nondeductible Employee Contributions are considered to
A
have been made in the Plan Year in which contributed to the Fund. Matching Contributions and Qualified Nonelective
Contributions will be considered made for a Plan Year if made no later than the end of the 12-month period beginning on the
day after the close of the Plan Year.
5. The Employer shall maintain records sufficient to demonstrate satisfaction of the ACP test and the amount of Qualified
Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions, or both, used in such test.
6. The determination and treatment of the Contribution Percentage of any Participant will satisfy such other requirements as may
S
be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
7. If the Employer elects to take Qualified Nonelective Contributions into account as Contribution Percentage Amounts for
purposes of the ACP test, then (subject to such other requirements as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) the
Employer may elect, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, either to include all Qualified Nonelective Contributions in the
ACP test or to include only the amount of such Qualified Nonelective Contributions that are needed to meet the ACP test.
8. If the Employer elects to take Elective Deferrals into account as Contribution Percentage Amounts for purposes of the ACP test,
then (subject to such other requirements as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) the Employer may elect, in a
uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, either to include all Elective Deferrals in the ACP test or to include only the amount of
such Elective Deferrals that are needed to meet the ACP test.
9. Special Rule for Early Participation – If the Plan provides for Matching Contributions or Nondeductible Employee Contributions
and provides that Employees are eligible to participate with regard to such contributions before they have completed the
minimum age and service requirements in Code section 410(a)(1)(A), and if the Plan applies Code section 410(b)(4)(B) in
determining whether the Plan meets the requirements in Code section 410(b)(1), then in determining whether the Plan meets
the ACP test, either:
a. pursuant to Code section 401(m)(5)(C), the ACP test is performed under the Plan (determined without regard to disaggregation
under Treasury Regulation section 1.410(b)-7(c)(3)), using the ACP for all eligible Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan
Year and the ACP of eligible non-Highly Compensated Employees for the applicable year, disregarding all non-Highly
Compensated Employees who have not met the minimum age and service requirements in Code section 410(a)(1)(A); or
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 41 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 47]
b. pursuant to Treasury Regulation section 1.401(m)-1(b)(4), the Plan is disaggregated into separate plans and the ACP test is
performed separately for all eligible Participants who have completed the minimum age and service requirements in Code
section 410(a)(1)(A) and for all eligible Participants who have not completed the minimum age and service requirements in
Code section 410(a)(1)(A).
C. Notwithstanding the preceding, the ACP test described above is treated as satisfied for any SIMPLE 401(k) Year in which an Eligible
Employer maintains this Plan as a SIMPLE 401(k) Plan. E
3.15 DEEMED IRAs
A. General Rules
1. This Plan Section 3.15 will apply if elected by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement.
2. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, each Participant may make Deemed IRA Contributions to the Participant’s
L
Deemed IRA under the Plan if the Plan allows such contributions.
3. Unless otherwise indicated in the Adoption Agreement, Deemed IRA Contributions, if permitted by the Plan, may be made to
either a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA established as a Deemed IRA under the Plan. At the time the Deemed IRA is established,
the IRA Owner will indicate whether the Deemed IRA is a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA for tax purposes.
4. The IRA Trustee (or Custodian) shall be subject to the reporting requirements of Code section 408(i) with respect to all Deemed
P
IRAs that are established and maintained under the Plan.
5. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, Deemed IRAs will be held in the Fund established in Plan Section 7.01.
When held within the Fund, the following rules will apply:
a. Separate Account – A separate account will be maintained for each Deemed IRA clearly designating the Deemed IRA as
either a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA.
b. Life InsuranMce – No Deemed IRA assets held in a separate account of the Fund will be invested in life insurance contracts.
c. Trustee – The IRA trustee (or custodian) must be either a bank or a nonbank trustee that satisfies the requirements of Code
section 408(a)(2) and the corresponding regulations. In addition, there cannot be separate trustees for each Deemed IRA
included in the Fund. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) of the Fund will be the IRA trustee (or custodian) if eligible to
serve in that capacity unless the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) appoints a bank or nonbank trustee to serve as IRA
trustee or custodian.
6. Deemed IRAs established pursuant to this Plan Section 3.15 must satisfy the applicable requirements of Code sections 408 and
408A. Deemed IRA assets held within the Fund must meet the applicable requirements set forth in Plan Section 7.02. Deemed IRA
Aassets held in separate individual trusts must meet the requirements of the separate written governing instrument establishing such
Deemed IRA, and these requirements are hereby incorporated by reference, provided the governing instrument is not inconsistent
with the provisions of the Plan. In the event that the separate governing instrument is inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, the
terms of the Plan will control. The Plan Administrator may, through separate agreement, adopt provisions governing Deemed IRAs
for the proper and efficient administration of Deemed IRA assets held in the Fund or in separate individual trusts.
7. The IRA Owner’s interest in the balance in this IRA is nonforfeitable at all times. No part of this IRA may be invested in
collectibles (within the meaning of Code section 408(m)) except as otherwise permitted by Code section 408(m)(3), which
Sprovides an exception for certain gold, silver, and platinum coins issued under the laws of any state, and certain bullion.
B. IRA Rules Under Code Section 408
1. Provisions Governing Roth IRAs Under Code Section 408A – This Plan Section 3.15(B)(1) will apply only if the Deemed IRA
created pursuant to this Plan Section 3.15 has been designated by the IRA Owner as a Roth IRA.
a. Contribution Rules.
i. Maximum Permissible Amount – Except in the case of a rollover contribution described in Code section 408A(e), a
recharacterized contribution described in Code section 408A(d)(6), or a conversion contribution, no contributions will be
accepted unless they are in cash, and the total of such contributions will not exceed the lesser of 100 percent of the Roth
IRA Owner’s compensation or $3,000 for any taxable year beginning in 2002 through 2004; $4,000 for any taxable year
beginning in 2005 through 2007; and $5,000 for any taxable year beginning in 2008 and years thereafter. After 2008, the
applicable contribution limit may be increased by the Secretary of the Treasury for cost-of-living adjustments under Code
section 219(b)(5)(D). Such adjustments will be in multiples of $500.
If the Roth IRA Owner makes regular contributions to both Roth and Traditional IRAs for a taxable year, the maximum
regular contribution that can be made to all the Roth IRA Owner’s Roth IRAs for that taxable year is reduced by the
regular contributions made to the Roth IRA Owner’s Traditional IRAs for the taxable year.
Contributions may be further limited if the Roth IRA Owner’s modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) exceeds the
limits described in Plan Section 3.15(B)(1)(a)(iii).
Qualified rollover contribution means a rollover contribution that meets the requirements of Code section 408(d)(3),
except that the one-rollover-per-year rule of Code section 408(d)(3)(B) does not apply if the rollover contribution is
from an IRA other than a Roth IRA.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 42 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 48]
ii. Catch-up Contributions – In the case of a Roth IRA Owner who is age 50 or older by the close of the taxable year, the
annual cash contribution limit is increased by $500 for any taxable year beginning in 2002 through 2005 and by $1,000
for any taxable year beginning in 2006 and years thereafter.
iii. Regular Contribution Limit – If a Roth IRA Owner’s MAGI falls within certain limits, the maximum regular
contribution that can be made to all the Roth IRA Owner’s Roth IRAs for a taxable year is phased out ratably. Effective
for taxable years beginning after 2006, these limitations (if applicable) will bEe increased under Code section 408A(c)(3)
to reflect cost-of-living adjustments.
iv. Conversion Contribution Limit – A SIMPLE IRA may only be converted to a Roth IRA if two years have passed since
the SIMPLE IRA Owner first participated in the SIMPLE IRA plan.
v. Recharacterization – A regular contribution to a Traditional or SIMPLE IRA may be recharacterized pursuant to the
rules in Treasury Regulation section 1.408A-5 as a regular contribution to this Deemed IRA, subject to the limits in Plan
Section 3.15(B)(1)(a). L
vi. Modified Adjusted Gross Income – For purposes of Plan Section 3.15(B)(1)(a)(iii), a Roth IRA Owner’s MAGI for a
taxable year is defined in Code section 408A(c)(3)(C)(i) and does not include any amount included in adjusted gross
income as a result of a conversion from a Traditional or SIMPLE IRA.
b. Roth IRA Owner Distributions – No amount is required to be distributed before the death of the Roth IRA Owner for whose
benefit the account was originally estabPlished. After the Roth IRA Owner’s death, however, the Beneficiary must begin
taking distributions in accordance with Plan Section 3.15(B)(1)(c). Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary,
distributions from the Roth IRA, including rollover distributions, will be governed by Code section 408A(d) and the terms of
the separate written governing instrument establishing such Deemed IRA.
c. Beneficiary Rights – If the Roth IRA Owner dies before their entire interest is distributed to them, the entire remaining
interest will be distributed as follows.
i. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the distribution of the Roth IRA Owner’s interest in the
M
account will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code section 408(a)(6), as modified by Code section
408A(c)(5), and the corresponding Treasury Regulations, the provisions of which are herein incorporated by reference.
If distributions are made from an annuity contract purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder
must satisfy the requirements of Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-6 (taking into account Code section
408A(c)(5)), rather than the distribution rules in Plan Section 3.15(B)(1)(c)(ii), (iii), and (iv).
ii. Upon the death of the Roth IRA Owner, their entire interest will be distributed as follows.
(a) If the designated beneficiary is someone other than the Roth IRA Owner’s surviving Spouse, the entire interest
will be distributed, starting by the end of the calendar year following the calendar year of the Roth IRA Owner’s
A
death, over the remaining life expectancy of the designated beneficiary, with such life expectancy determined
using the age of the designated beneficiary as of their birthday in the year following the year of the Roth IRA
Owner’s death, or, if elected, in accordance with Plan Section 3.15(B)(1)(c)(ii)(c).
(b) If the Roth IRA Owner’s sole designated beneficiary is their surviving Spouse, the entire interest will be distributed,
starting by the end of the calendar year following the calendar year of the Roth IRA Owner’s death (or by the end of
the calendar year in which the Roth IRA Owner would have attained age 70½, if later), over such Spouse’s life, or, if
elected, in accordance with Plan Section 3.15(B)(1)(c)(ii)(c). If the surviving Spouse dies before distributions are
S
required to begin, the remaining interest will be distributed, starting by the end of the calendar year following the
calendar year of the Spouse’s death, over the Spouse’s designated beneficiary’s remaining life expectancy
determined using such designated beneficiary’s age as of their birthday in the year following the death of the
Spouse, or, if elected, will be distributed in accordance with Plan Section 3.15(B)(1)(c)(ii)(c). If the surviving Spouse
dies after distributions are required to begin, any remaining interest will be distributed over the Spouse’s remaining
life expectancy determined using the Spouse’s age as of their birthday in the year of the Spouse’s death.
(c) If there is no designated beneficiary, or if applicable by operation of Plan Section 3.15(B)(1)(c)(ii)(a) or (b), the
entire interest will be distributed by the end of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Roth IRA
Owner’s death (or of the Spouse’s death in the case of the surviving Spouse’s death before distributions are
required to begin under Plan Section 3.15(B)(1)(c)(ii)(b)).
(d) The amount otherwise to be distributed each year under this Plan Section 3.15(B)(1)(c) is the quotient obtained
by dividing the value of the IRA as of the end of the preceding year by the remaining life expectancy specified in
such paragraph. Life expectancy is determined using the Single Life Table in Q&A 1 of Treasury Regulation
section 1.401(a)(9)-9. If the distributions are being made to a surviving Spouse as the sole designated beneficiary,
such Spouse’s remaining life expectancy for a year is the number in the Single Life Table corresponding to such
Spouse’s age in the year. In all other cases, remaining life expectancy for a year is the number in the Single Life
Table corresponding to the beneficiary’s age in the year specified in Plan Section 3.15(B)(2)(a) or (b) and reduced
by one for each subsequent year.
iii. The value of the Roth IRA for purposes of this Plan Section 3.15 is the prior December 31 balance adjusted to include
the amount of any outstanding rollovers, transfers, and recharacterizations under Q&As 7 and 8 of Treasury
Regulation section 1.408-8.

iv. If the designated beneficiary is the Roth IRA Owner’s surviving Spouse, the Spouse may elect to treat the IRA as their
own Roth IRA. This election will be deemed to have been made if such surviving Spouse, who is the sole beneficiary of
the Roth IRA, makes a contribution to the Roth IRA or fails to take a required distribution as a beneficiary.
2. Provisions Governing Traditional IRAs Under Code Section 408 – This Plan Section 3.15(B)(2) will only apply if the IRA created
pursuant to this Plan Section 3.15 has been designated by the IRA Owner as a Traditional IRA.
E
a. Contribution Rules.
i. Maximum Permissible Amount – Except in the case of a rollover contribution (as permitted by Code sections 402(c),
402(e)(6), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 403(b)(10), 408(d)(3), and 457(e)(16)) or a contribution made in accordance with the
terms of a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plan as described in Code section 408(k), no contributions will be
accepted unless they are in cash, and the total of such contributions will not exceed the lesser of 100 percent of the
Traditional IRA Owner’s compensation, or $3,000 for any taxable year beginning in 2002 through 2004; $4,000 for any
taxable year beginning in 2005 through 2007; and $5,00L0 for any taxable year beginning in 2008 and years thereafter.
After 2008, the limit will be adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for cost-of-living increases under Code section
219(b)(5)(D). Such adjustments will be in multiples of $500.
If the Traditional IRA Owner makes regular contributions to both Traditional and Roth IRAs for a taxable year, the
maximum regular contribution that can be made to all the Traditional IRA Owner’s Traditional IRAs for that taxable
year is reduced by the regular conPtributions made to the Traditional IRA Owner’s Roth IRAs for the taxable year.
ii. Catch-up Contributions – In the case of a Traditional IRA Owner who is age 50 or older by the close of the taxable
year, the annual cash contribution limit is increased by $500 for any taxable year beginning in 2002 through 2005, and
by $1,000 for any taxable year beginning in 2006 and years thereafter.
iii. SIMPLE IRA – No contributions will be accepted under a SIMPLE IRA plan established by any employer pursuant to
Code section 408(p). Also, no transfer or rollover of funds attributable to contributions made by a particular employer
under its SIMPLE IRA plan will be accepted from a SIMPLE IRA, that is, an IRA used in conjunction with a SIMPLE IRA
M
plan, before the expiration of the two-year period beginning on the date the employee first participated in that
employer’s SIMPLE IRA plan.
b. Traditional IRA Owner Distributions.
i. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the distribution of the Traditional IRA Owner’s interest in
this Traditional IRA will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code sections 408(a)(6) and 408(d) and the
corresponding regulations, the provisions of which are herein incorporated by reference. If distributions are made
from an annuity contract purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder must satisfy the
requirements of Q&A 4 of Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-6, rather than Plan Section 3.15(B)(2)(b)(ii), (iii) and
A
(iv) and (B)(2)(c). The required minimum distributions calculated for this Traditional IRA may be withdrawn from
another Traditional IRA of the Traditional IRA Owner in accordance with Q&A 9 of Treasury Regulation section 1.408-8.
ii. The entire value of the account of the Traditional IRA Owner for whose benefit the account is maintained will begin to
be distributed no later than the first day of April following the calendar year in which such Traditional IRA Owner
attains age 70½ (the required beginning date) over the life of such Traditional IRA Owner or the lives of such
Traditional IRA Owner and their designated beneficiary.
Siii. The amount to be distributed each year, beginning with the calendar year in which the Traditional IRA Owner attains
age 70½ and continuing through the year of death, will not be less than the quotient obtained by dividing the value
of the Traditional IRA (as modified by Plan Section 3.15(B)(2)(c)(iii)) as of the end of the preceding year by the
distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table in Q&A 2 of Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-9, using the
Traditional IRA Owner’s age as of their birthday in the year. However, if the Traditional IRA Owner’s sole designated
beneficiary is their surviving Spouse and such Spouse is more than 10 years younger than the Traditional IRA Owner,
then the distribution period is determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table in Q&A 3 of Treasury Regulation
section 1.401(a)(9)-9, using the ages as of the Traditional IRA Owner’s and Spouse’s birthdays in that year.
iv. The required minimum distribution for the year the Traditional IRA Owner attains age 70½ can be made as late as
April 1 of the following year. The required minimum distribution for any other year must be made by the end of such
year.
c. Beneficiary Rights – If the Traditional IRA Owner dies before their entire interest is distributed to them, the entire remaining
interest will be distributed as follows.
i. Death on or After Required Beginning Date – If the Traditional IRA Owner dies on or after the required beginning
date, the remaining portion of their interest will be distributed as follows.
(a) If the designated beneficiary is someone other than the Traditional IRA Owner’s surviving Spouse, the remaining
interest will be distributed over the remaining life expectancy of the designated beneficiary, with such life
expectancy determined using the beneficiary’s age as of their birthday in the year following the year of the
Traditional IRA Owner’s death, or over the period described in Plan Section 3.15(B)(2)(c)(i)(c), if longer.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 44 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 50]
(b) If the Traditional IRA Owner’s sole designated beneficiary is the Traditional IRA Owner’s surviving Spouse, the
remaining interest will be distributed over such Spouse’s life or over the period described in Plan Section
3.15(B)(2)(c)(i)(c), if longer. Any interest remaining after such Spouse’s death will be distributed over such Spouse’s
remaining life expectancy determined using the Spouse’s age as of their birthday in the year of the Spouse’s death,
or, if the distributions are being made over the period described in Plan Section 3.15(B)(2)(c)(i)(c), over such period.
(c) If there is no designated beneficiary, or if applicable by operation of PElan Section 3.15(B)(2)(c)(i)(a) and (b), the
remaining interest will be distributed over the Traditional IRA Owner’s remaining life expectancy determined in
the year of the Traditional IRA Owner’s death.
(d) The amount to be distributed each year under Plan Section 3.15(B)(2)(c)(i)(a), (b), and (c) beginning with the calendar
year following the calendar year of the Traditional IRA Owner’s death, is the quotient obtained by dividing the value
of the Traditional IRA as of the end of the preceding year by the remaining life expectancy specified in Plan Section
3.15(B)(2)(c). Life expectancy is determined using the Single Life Table in Q&A 1 of Treasury Regulation section
L
1.401(a)(9)-9. If distributions are being made to a surviving Spouse as the sole designated beneficiary, such Spouse’s
remaining life expectancy for a year is the number in the Single Life Table corresponding to such Spouse’s age in the
year. In all other cases, remaining life expectancy for a year is the number in the Single Life Table corresponding to
the designated beneficiary’s or Traditional IRA Owner’s age in the year specified in Plan Section 3.15(B)(2)(c)(i)(a), (b),
and (c) and reduced by one for each subsequent year.
ii. Death Before Required BeginninPg Date – If the Traditional IRA Owner dies before the required beginning date, their
entire interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as follows.
(a) If the designated beneficiary is someone other than the Traditional IRA Owner’s surviving Spouse, the entire
interest will be distributed, starting by the end of the calendar year following the calendar year of the Traditional
IRA Owner’s death, over the remaining life expectancy of the designated beneficiary, with such life expectancy
determined using the age of the beneficiary as of their birthday in the year following the year of the Traditional
IRA Owner’s death, or, if elected, in accordance with Plan Section 3.15(B)(2)(c)(ii)(c).
M
(b) If the Traditional IRA Owner’s sole designated beneficiary is the Traditional IRA Owner’s surviving Spouse, the entire
interest will be distributed, starting by the end of the calendar year following the calendar year of the Traditional IRA
Owner’s death (or by the end of the calendar year in which the Traditional IRA Owner would have attained age 70½,
if later), over such Spouse’s life, or, if elected, in accordance with Plan Section 3.15(B)(2)(c)(ii)(c). If the surviving
Spouse dies before distributions are required to begin, the remaining interest will be distributed, starting by the end
of the calendar year following the calendar year of the Spouse’s death, over the Spouse’s designated beneficiary’s
remaining life expectancy determined using such beneficiary’s age as of their birthday in the year following the
death of the Spouse, or, if elected, will be distributed in accordance with Plan Section 3.15(B)(2)(c)(ii)(c). If the
surviving Spouse dies after distributions are required to begin, any remaining interest will be distributed over the
ASpouse’s remaining life expectancy determined using the Spouse’s age as of their birthday in the year of the
Spouse’s death.
(c) If there is no designated beneficiary, or if applicable by operation of Plan Section 3.15(B)(2)(c)(ii)(a) and (b), the
entire interest will be distributed by the end of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the
Traditional IRA Owner’s death (or of the Spouse’s death in the case of the surviving Spouse’s death before
distributions are required to begin under Plan Section 3.15(B)(2)(c)(ii)(b)).
S(d) The amount otherwise to be distributed each year under this Plan Section 3.15(B)(2)(c)(ii)(a) and (b) is the
quotient obtained by dividing the value of the IRA as of the end of the preceding year by the remaining life
expectancy specified in such paragraph. Life expectancy is determined using the Single Life Table in Q&A 1 of
Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-9. If the distributions are being made to a surviving Spouse as the sole
designated beneficiary, such Spouse’s remaining life expectancy for a year is the number in the Single Life Table
corresponding to such Spouse’s age in the year. In all other cases, remaining life expectancy for a year is the
number in the Single Life Table corresponding to the beneficiary’s age in the year specified in Plan Section
3.15(B)(2)(a) or (b) and reduced by one for each subsequent year.
iii. The value of the Traditional IRA for purposes of this section is the prior December 31 balance adjusted to include the
amount of any outstanding rollovers, transfers and recharacterizations under Treasury Regulation section 1.408-8, Q&As 7
and 8.
iv. If the designated beneficiary is the Traditional IRA Owner’s surviving Spouse, the Spouse may elect to treat the
Traditional IRA as their own Traditional IRA. This election will be deemed to have been made if such surviving Spouse,
who is the sole beneficiary of the Traditional IRA, makes a contribution to the Traditional IRA or fails to take required
distributions as a beneficiary.
3.16 IN-PLAN ROTH ROLLOVERS
A. Eligibility – If elected by the Adopting Employer in the Adoption Agreement, Recipients may complete Direct In-Plan Roth Rollovers.
Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, a Plan that allows Direct In-Plan Roth Rollovers will allow Direct In-Plan Roth
Rollovers of all non-Roth contributions.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 45 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 51]
If elected by the Adopting Employer in the Adoption Agreement, Recipients may complete Indirect In-Plan Roth Rollovers for any
Eligible Rollover Distribution from the Plan.
Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, Recipients may complete an unlimited number of In-Plan Roth Rollovers.
B. Separate Accounting – Contributions and withdrawals of In-Plan Roth Rollover contributions will be credited and debited to an In-Plan
Roth Rollover account maintained for each Participant. The Plan will maintain a record of the Eamount of In-Plan Roth Rollover
contributions in each Participant’s Individual Account. Gains, losses, and other credits or charges must be separately allocated on a
reasonable and consistent basis to each Participant’s In-Plan Roth Rollover account and the Participant’s other accounts under the Plan.
No contributions other than In-Plan Roth Rollover contributions and properly attributable earnings will be credited to each
Participant’s In-Plan Roth Rollover account.
C. Distributable Events – Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, a Recipient may complete a Direct In-Plan Roth
Rollover at any time. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, a Recipient does not have to be fully Vested in an eligible
L
account to complete a Direct In-Plan Roth Rollover.
If a Recipient completes a Direct In-Plan Roth Rollover of an amount that is eligible for distribution under the Code and/or Treasury
Regulations, the Plan Administrator, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner and as allowed under the Code and rules
promulgated by the IRS, may establish operational procedures allowing a Recipient to elect to gross-up their distribution for
voluntary tax withholding purposes.
P
Except for amounts withheld pursuant to a voluntary withholding election by the Recipient, Direct In-Plan Roth Rollovers will not be
considered distributions from the Plan for the purposes of Code sections 72(p), 401(a)(11), 411(d)(6)(B)(ii) or other Code sections
pursuant to rules promulgated by the IRS.
D. Loans – If elected by the Adopting Employer in the Adoption Agreement, a Recipient may include any outstanding loan amount
attributable to an eligible account in a Direct In-Plan Roth Rollover. Loan amounts included in a Direct In-Plan Roth Rollover will
continue to be subject to the Plan’s loan rules and the Plan’s loan policy. In addition, the terms of the Loan must remain the same
following the Direct In-Plan Roth Rollover.
M
If the Participant’s Individual Account contains In-Plan Roth Rollover contributions, the specific rules governing the loan program may
also designate the extent to which In-Plan Roth Rollover contributions will 1) be used to calculate the maximum amount available for
a loan, or 2) be available as a source from which loan proceeds may be taken or which may be used as security for a loan. To the
extent permitted by law and related regulations, the rules established by the Plan Administrator may specify the ordering rules to be
applied in the event of a defaulted loan.
SECTION FOUR: VESTING AND FORFEITURES
4.01 DEATERMINING THE VESTED PORTION OF PARTICIPANT INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS
A. Determining the Vested Portion – In determining the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account, the following rules apply.
1. Employer Contributions – The Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account derived from Employer Contributions other than
Elective Deferrals is determined by applying the vesting schedule(s) selected in the Adoption Agreement (or the vesting schedule(s)
described in Plan Section 4.01(B) if the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan). In the event that there is not a vesting schedule option provided in
the Adoption Agreement, a Participant will be fully Vested in their Individual Account at all times.
S
2. Other Contributions – A Participant is fully Vested in their rollover contributions and transfer contributions (subject to the
exceptions provided in Plan Section 3.08), Elective Deferrals, Deductible Employee Contributions, Nondeductible Employee
Contributions, Qualified Matching Contributions, and Qualified Nonelective Contributions, and any earnings thereon. No
Forfeiture will occur solely as a result of an Employee’s withdrawal of such contributions. Separate accounts for such
contributions will be maintained for each Employee, including separate accounts for Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective
Deferrals. Each account will be credited with the applicable contributions and earnings thereon.
3. Fully Vested Under Certain Circumstances – Full vesting of Individual Accounts occurs when:
a. the Employee reaches Normal Retirement Age;
b. the Plan is terminated or partially terminated, as defined by rules promulgated by the IRS, and the Participant is an affected
participant; or
c. there exists a complete discontinuance of contributions under the Plan and the Participant is an affected participant.
Further, unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, an Employee is fully Vested if the Employee dies, incurs a Disability, or
satisfies the conditions for Early Retirement Age (if applicable). Notwithstanding the preceding, the portion of an Employee’s
Individual Account attributable to Employer Profit Sharing Contributions or Employer Money Purchase Pension Contributions that
are made based on their imputed Compensation on account of incurring a Disability will be fully Vested at all times.
4. Participants under a Prior Plan Document – If a Participant was a participant under a Prior Plan Document on the Effective Date, their
Vested percentage will not be less than it would have been under such Prior Plan Document as computed on the Effective Date.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 46 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 52]
5. SIMPLE 401(k) Exception – Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, all benefits attributable to contributions
described in Plan Section 3.01(I) are nonforfeitable at all times, and all previous contributions made under the Plan are
nonforfeitable as of the beginning of the SIMPLE 401(k) Year in which the SIMPLE 401(k) Plan is adopted.
6. ADP Test Safe Harbor Contribution Exception – Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, all benefits attributable to
ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions will be nonforfeitable at all times.
E
7. ACP Test Safe Harbor Matching Contributions – Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, ACP Test Safe Harbor
Matching Contributions will be Vested as indicated in the Matching Contributions vesting schedule in the Adoption Agreement,
but, in any event, such contributions will be fully Vested upon an Employee’s attainment of Normal Retirement Age, upon the
complete or partial termination of the Plan, or upon the complete discontinuance of Employer Contributions.
8. Employer Prevailing Wage Contributions – Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, contributions made by an
Employer pursuant to Plan Section 3.04(B)(3) will be nonforfeitable at all times.
L
A Participant will not be fully Vested in their Individual Account solely on account of a transaction described in Code section 414(l),
except as otherwise provided therein.
B. Minimum Vesting Schedule for Top-Heavy Plans – The following vesting provisions apply for any Plan Year in which this Plan is a
Top-Heavy Plan.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Plan Section 4.01 (unless those provisions provide for more rapid vesting), the top-heavy
P
Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account derived from Employer Contributions and Forfeitures is determined by applying
the vesting schedule(s) selected in the Adoption Agreement for the source to which the contribution is attributable.
The vesting schedule(s) selected in the Adoption Agreement applies to all benefits within the meaning of Code section 411(a)(7),
except for those benefits that are nonforfeitable under the Code (e.g., Nondeductible Employee Contributions, including benefits
accrued before the effective date of Code section 416 and benefits accrued before the Plan became a Top-Heavy Plan, Elective
Deferrals, Qualified Nonelective Contributions, Qualified Matching Contributions, and ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions). Further,
no decrease in a Participant’s Vested percentage may occur in the event the Plan’s status as a Top-Heavy Plan changes for any Plan
M
Year. However, this Plan Section 4.01(B) does not apply to the Individual Account of any Employee who does not have an Hour of
Service after the Plan has initially become a Top-Heavy Plan, and such Employee’s Individual Account attributable to Employer
Contributions and Forfeitures will be determined without regard to this Plan Section 4.01(B).
C. Termination of Employment – If a Participant incurs a Termination of Employment, any portion of their Individual Account which is not
Vested may be held in a Forfeiture account. Such Forfeiture account will share in any increase or decrease in the fair market value of the
assets of the Fund in accordance with Plan Section 7.02(B). The disposition of such Forfeiture account will be as follows.
1. Cashout of Certain Terminated Participants – If the Vested value of a terminated Participant’s Individual Account does not
exceed $1,000 (or such other cashout level specified in the Adoption Agreement), the Vested value of the Participant’s Individual
A
Account may be paid from the Plan pursuant to Plan Sections 5.01(B)(1) and 5.04(A), subject to a uniform and nondiscriminatory
policy established by the Plan Administrator. The portion which is not Vested will be treated as a Forfeiture and applied in
accordance with Plan Section 3.04(C). If a Participant would have received the Vested portion of their Individual Account
pursuant to the previous sentence but for the fact that the Participant’s Vested Individual Account exceeded the cashout amount
when the Participant terminated service, and if at a later time such Individual Account is reduced such that it is not greater than
the cashout level, the Vested portion of the Participant’s Individual Account will be paid from the Plan and the portion that is not
Vested will be treated as a Forfeiture and applied in accordance with Plan Section 3.04(C). For purposes of this Plan Section, if
Sthe value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account is zero, the Participant will be deemed to have received a
distribution of such Vested Individual Account.
2. Terminated Participants Who Elect to Receive Distributions – If such terminated Participant elects to receive a distribution of the
entire Vested portion of their Individual Account in accordance with Plan Section 5.01(B)(2), the portion that is not Vested will be
treated as a Forfeiture. Such Forfeiture will be applied in accordance with Plan Section 3.04(C). If such terminated Participant
elects to receive a partial distribution of their Vested Individual Account, no Forfeiture may occur until the Participant elects to
receive the remaining portion of their Vested Individual Account.
3. Reemployed Participants Who Received Distributions – If such Participant is deemed to receive a distribution pursuant to Plan
Section 4.01(C)(1) and the Participant subsequently resumes employment before the date the Participant incurs five consecutive
Breaks in Vesting Service, upon the reemployment of such Participant, the Employer-derived Individual Account balance will be
restored to the amount on the date of the deemed distribution. If such Participant receives a distribution pursuant to Plan
Section 4.01(C)(1) or (2) and the Participant subsequently resumes employment, the Participant’s Employer-derived Individual
Account balance will be restored to the amount on the date of distribution if the Participant repays to the Plan the full amount
of the distribution that was subject to a vesting schedule before the earlier of
a. five years after the first date on which the Participant is subsequently reemployed by the Employer, or
b. the date the Participant incurs five consecutive Breaks in Vesting Service following the date of the distribution.
Any restoration of a Participant’s Individual Account pursuant to this Plan Section 4.01(C)(3) will be made from other Forfeitures,
income or gain to the Fund, or contributions made by the Employer.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 47 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 53]
4. Reemployed Participants Who Did Not Receive Distributions – If such Participant neither receives nor is deemed to receive a
distribution pursuant to Plan Section 4.01(C)(1) or (2), and the Participant returns to the service of the Employer before incurring
five consecutive Breaks in Vesting Service, there will be no Forfeiture. Rather, the amount in such Forfeiture account will be
restored to such Participant’s Individual Account.
D. Vesting Breaks in Service
E
1. Vesting of Pre-Break Accruals – Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable) credited after a Participant incurs five
consecutive Breaks in Vesting Service will be disregarded in determining the Vested portion of such Participant’s Individual
Account that was accrued before the five consecutive Breaks in Vesting Service. If a Participant who has neither received a
distribution nor has been deemed to receive a distribution incurs five consecutive Breaks in Vesting Service, the portion of the
Participant’s Individual Account that is not Vested will be treated as a Forfeiture and applied in accordance with Plan Section
3.04(C).
2. Vesting of Post-Break Accruals – Years of Vesting Service (Periods Lof Service, if applicable) credited before a Break in Vesting
Service will apply for purposes of determining the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account that is accrued after such
Break in Vesting Service. Notwithstanding the preceding, if elected in the Adoption Agreement, Years of Vesting Service credited
before a Break in Vesting Service will not be taken into account until the Participant has completed a Year of Vesting Service
(Period of Service, if applicable) after returning to employment, if applicable.
E. Distribution Before Full Vesting – If a distribution is made to a Participant who was not then fully Vested in their Individual Account
P
derived from Employer Contributions, and if the Participant may increase their Vested percentage in their Individual Account, then the
following rules will apply:
1. a separate account will be established for the Participant’s interest in the Plan as of the time of the distribution, and
2. at any relevant time, the Participant’s Vested portion of the separate account will be equal to an amount (“X”) determined in
accordance with either the standard formula or the alternative formula. The applicable formula must be used in a uniform and
nondiscriminatory manner.
M
Standard Formula: X = P (AB + (R x D)) – (R x D)
Alternative Formula: X = P (AB+D) – D
For purposes of the standard and alternative formulas described above, “P” is the Vested percentage at the relevant time; “AB” is the
separate account balance at the relevant time; “D” is the amount of the distribution; and “R” is the ratio of the separate account
balance at the relevant time to the separate account balance after distribution.
F. QACA ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions – Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, QACA ADP Test Safe Harbor
Contributions will be Vested as indicated in the Adoption Agreement over a period that may not exceed two years. If no election is
Amade, all benefits attributable to such contributions will be fully Vested at all times. In addition, such contributions will be fully Vested
upon an Employee’s attainment of Normal Retirement Age, upon the complete or partial termination of the Plan, or upon the
complete discontinuance of Employer Contributions.
G. QACA ACP Test Safe Harbor Matching Contributions – Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, QACA ACP Test Safe
Harbor Matching Contributions will be Vested according to the vesting provisions for Matching Contributions selected in the Adoption
Agreement, but, in any event, such contributions will be fully Vested upon an Employee’s attainment of Normal Retirement Age, upon the
complete or partial termination of the Plan, or upon the complete discontinuance of Employer Contributions.
S
4.02 100 PERCENT VESTING OF CERTAIN CONTRIBUTIONS
The Participant’s accrued benefit derived from Elective Deferrals, Qualified Nonelective Contributions, ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions,
Nondeductible Employee Contributions, and Qualified Matching Contributions is nonforfeitable. Separate accounts for Pre-Tax Elective
Deferrals, Roth Elective Deferrals, Qualified Nonelective Contributions, Nondeductible Employee Contributions, Matching Contributions,
and Qualified Matching Contributions will be maintained for each Participant. Each account will be credited with the applicable
contributions and earnings thereon.
4.03 FORFEITURES AND VESTING OF MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS
Matching Contributions, other than Qualified Matching Contributions, will be Vested in accordance with the vesting schedule for Matching
Contributions in the Adoption Agreement. In any event, an Employee’s Matching Contributions will be fully Vested at Normal Retirement
Age, upon the complete termination of the Plan, or, for affected participants, upon the partial termination or complete discontinuance of
Employer Contributions. Matching Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions must be forfeited if the contributions to which they
relate are Excess Elective Deferrals (unless the Excess Elective Deferrals are for non-Highly Compensated Employees, in which event the
Plan Administrator will have discretion as to whether such amounts will be forfeited), Excess Contributions, Excess Aggregate
Contributions, or Excess Annual Additions that are distributed pursuant to Plan Section 3.12(A)(4). Such Forfeitures will be allocated in
accordance with Plan Section 3.04(C).
When a Participant incurs a Termination of Employment, whether a Forfeiture arises with respect to Matching Contributions will be
determined in accordance with Plan Section 4.01(C).
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 48 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 54]
4.04 FORFEITURES OF QACA ADP TEST SAFE HARBOR CONTRIBUTIONS AND QACA ACP TEST SAFE HARBOR MATCHING
CONTRIBUTIONS
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, QACA Basic Matching Contributions, QACA Enhanced Matching Contributions, or QACA
ACP Test Safe Harbor Matching Contributions must be forfeited if the contributions to which they relate are Excess Elective Deferrals
(unless the Excess Elective Deferrals are for non-Highly Compensated Employees, in which event the Plan Administrator will have discretion
as to whether such amounts will be forfeited), or Excess Annual Additions that are distributed acEcording to provisions in Plan Section 3.12.
Such Forfeitures will be allocated in accordance with Plan Section 3.04(C) as it relates to Matching Contributions.
Matching Contributions (adjusted for gain or loss) that have been allocated to a Contributing Participant’s account under the EACA or
QACA provisions, and that relate to Elective Deferrals permissively withdrawn, must be forfeited. Such Forfeitures will be allocated in
accordance with Plan Section 3.04(C) as it relates to Matching Contributions.
When a Participant incurs a Termination of Employment, whether a Forfeiture arises, with respect to QACA Basic Matching Contributions,
QACA Enhanced Matching Contributions, QACA Safe Harbor Nonelective Contributions, or QACA ACP Test Safe Harbor Matching
L
Contributions, will be determined in accordance with Plan Section 4.01(C).
SECTION FIVE: DISTRIBUTIONS AND LOANS TO PARTICIPANTS
5.01 DISTRIBUTIONS
P
A. Eligibility for Distributions
1. Entitlement to Distribution – The Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account attributable to Employer Contributions
(including ACP Test Safe Harbor Matching Contributions and QACA ACP Test Safe Harbor Matching Contributions) other than those
described in Plan Section 5.01(A)(2) will be distributable to the Participant upon 1) the Participant satisfying the distribution eligibility
requirements specified in the Adoption Agreement, 2) the Participant’s Termination of Employment after attaining Normal
Retirement Age, 3) the termination of the Plan, or 4) if the Plan designates an Early Retirement Age, the Participant’s Termination of
Employment afteMr satisfying any Early Retirement Age conditions. Such Employer Contributions will also be distributed to the
Beneficiary upon the Participant’s death. If a Participant separates from service before satisfying the Early Retirement Age
requirement, but has satisfied the service requirement, the Participant will be entitled to elect an early retirement benefit upon
satisfying such age requirement. With respect to item 1) above, if the Adoption Agreement does not allow an Employer to specify
distribution eligibility requirements, the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account will be distributable to the Participant
upon the Participant’s Termination of Employment, attainment of Normal Retirement Age, Disability, attainment of age 59½ (if this
Plan is a profit sharing or 401(k) plan), or the termination of the Plan. If a Participant who is entitled to a distribution is not legally
competent to request or consent to a distribution, the Participant’s court-appointed guardian, an attorney-in-fact acting under a
valid power of attorney, or any other individual or entity authorized under state law to act on behalf of the Participant, may request
and accept a distribution of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account under this Plan Section 5.01(A).
A
2. Special Requirements for Certain 401(k) Contributions – Elective Deferrals, Qualified Nonelective Contributions, Qualified Matching
Contributions, and income allocable to each are not distributable to a Participant or their Beneficiary or Beneficiaries, in accordance
with such Participant’s or Beneficiaries’ election, earlier than upon the Participant’s Severance from Employment, death, or Disability,
except as listed below.
Such amounts may also be distributed upon any one of the following events:
Sa. termination of the Plan without the establishment of another defined contribution plan, other than an employee stock
ownership plan (as defined in Code section 4975(e) or Code section 409), a simplified employee pension plan (as defined in
Code section 408(k)), a SIMPLE IRA Plan (as defined in Code section 408(p)), a plan or contract described in Code section
403(b), or a plan described in Code section 457(b) or (f), at any time during the period beginning on the date of Plan
termination and ending twelve months after all assets have been distributed from the Plan;
b. attainment of age 59½ in the case of a profit sharing plan, if elected in the Adoption Agreement. Notwithstanding the
preceding, where no election is available in the Adoption Agreement, distribution of Elective Deferrals will be permitted
upon the attainment of age 59½;
c. existence of a hardship incurred by the Participant as described in Plan Section 5.01(C)(2)(b), if elected in the Adoption
Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding, where no election is available in the Adoption Agreement, distribution of
Elective Deferrals will be permitted upon the existence of a hardship as described in Plan Section 5.01(C)(2)(b);
d. unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, existence of a Deemed Severance from Employment under Code
section 414(u)(12)(B) during a period of uniformed services as defined in Code section 3401(h)(2)(A). Notwithstanding the
preceding, where no election is available in the Adoption Agreement, distribution of Elective Deferrals will be permitted
upon a Deemed Severance from Employment. If an individual receives a distribution due to a Deemed Severance from
Employment, the individual may not make an Elective Deferral or Nondeductible Employee Contribution during the six-
month period beginning on the date of the distribution. However, a distribution under this provision that is also a qualified
reservist distribution within the meaning of Code section 72(t)(2)(G)(iii) is not subject to the six-month suspension of
Elective Deferrals; or
e. a federally declared disaster as described in Plan Section 5.01(D)(4).

All distributions that may be made pursuant to one or more of the preceding distribution eligibility requirements are subject to
the spousal and Participant consent requirements (if applicable) contained in Code section 401(a)(11) and 417. In addition,
distributions that are triggered by either a., b., or c. above must be made in a lump sum.
Notwithstanding the preceding, ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions or QACA ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions are subject to
the same distribution restrictions as listed above for Elective Deferrals, except that no distribution can be made from ADP Test
Safe Harbor Contributions or QACA ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions due to the eExistence of a hardship as described in Plan
Section 5.01(C)(2).
Notwithstanding the preceding, unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, contributions made to the Plan under the
EACA or QACA provisions of the Plan may be distributed as permissible withdrawals in accordance with the following:
Permissible Withdrawals – Elective Deferrals made according to the Plan under either the EACA or the QACA (provided the
QACA otherwise satisfies Code section 414(w)) provisions may be withdrawn from the Plan penalty free if the following
conditions are satisfied. First, the permissible withdrawal is maLde pursuant to an election to withdraw by the Participant.
Second, unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, the election to withdraw made by the Participant is made no
later than the date that is 30 days after the date of the first Elective Deferral of such Participant made under either the EACA
or QACA provisions (i.e., after the pay date the Compensation would otherwise have been included in gross income). For
purposes of determining the date of the first default elective contribution, all EACAs under the Plan covering Employees
who cannot be disaggregated under Code section 410(b) must be aggregated. Third, the permissible withdrawal consists of
Elective Deferrals (adjusted for gain or Ploss) made to the Plan under the EACA or QACA provisions through the effective
date of the election. The effective date of the election to withdraw will be no later than the earlier of 1) the pay date for the
second payroll period beginning after the election is made, or 2) the first pay date that occurs at least 30 days after the
election was made.
An affirmative election made by a Participant will not restrict their right to take a permissible withdrawal provided the
conditions above are satisfied. Matching Contributions (adjusted for gain or loss) that have been allocated to a Participant’s
account under the EACA or QACA provisions, and that relate to Elective Deferrals permissively withdrawn, must be forfeited
and excludMed from nondiscrimination testing. Such Forfeitures will be allocated in accordance with Plan Section 3.04(C) as it
relates to Matching Contributions. Matching Contributions need not be made if the Elective Deferrals to which they relate are
withdrawn before the date the Matching Contributions would otherwise have been allocated.
Distributions made pursuant to the permissible withdrawal provisions found in this Plan Section 5.01(A)(2) are not subject to
the spousal and Participant consent requirements (if applicable) contained in Code section 401(a)(11) and 417.
For years beginning after 2005, if both Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals were made for the year, the Plan
Administrator, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, may establish operational procedures, including ordering rules as
permitted under the law and related regulations, that specify whether distributions, including corrective distributions of Excess
Elective Deferrals, Excess Contributions, Excess Aggregate Contributions, or Excess Annual Additions, will consist of a
A
Participant’s Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals, Roth Elective Deferrals, or a combination of both, to the extent such type of Elective
Deferral was made for the year. The operational procedures may include an option for Participants to designate whether the
distribution is being made from Pre-Tax or Roth Elective Deferrals.
3. Distribution Request: When Distributed – A Participant or Beneficiary entitled to a distribution who wishes to receive a distribution
must submit a request (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Plan
Administrator. If required in writing, such request will be made upon a form provided or approved by the Plan Administrator. Unless
Sotherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, upon a valid request, the Plan Administrator will direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if
applicable) to commence distribution as soon as administratively feasible after the request is received.
Distributions will be made based on the value of the Vested portion of the Individual Account available at the time of actual
distribution. To the extent the distribution request is for an amount greater than the Individual Account, the Trustee (or
Custodian, if applicable) will be entitled to distribute the entire Vested portion of the Individual Account.
B. Distributions Upon Termination of Employment
1. Individual Account Balances Less Than or Equal to Cashout Level – If the value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual
Account does not exceed the cashout level, the following rules will apply regarding Plan Section 4.01(C)(1).
a. If the value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account does not qualify as an Eligible Rollover Distribution,
distribution from the Plan may be made to the Participant in a single lump sum in lieu of all other forms of distribution under
the Plan.
b. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, if the value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account
does not exceed $1,000 and qualifies as an Eligible Rollover Distribution, and the Participant does not elect to have such
distribution paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Participant in a Direct Rollover or to receive the
distribution in accordance with this Section Five of the Plan, distribution will be made to the Participant in a single lump sum in
lieu of all other forms of distribution under the Plan.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 50 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 56]
c. If the value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account exceeds $1,000 and qualifies as an Eligible Rollover
Distribution, and if the Participant does not elect to have such distribution paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified
by the Participant in a Direct Rollover or to receive the distribution in accordance with this Section Five of the Plan, distribution
will be paid by the Plan Administrator in a Direct Rollover to an individual retirement arrangement (as described in Code
section 408(a), 408(b) or 408A) designated by the Plan Administrator.
Distributions made under this paragraph will occur following the Participant’s TerminatiEon of Employment in accordance with a
uniform and nondiscriminatory schedule established by the Plan Administrator. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Participant is
reemployed by the Employer before the occurrence of the distribution, no distribution will be made under this paragraph.
Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, the value of the Participant’s Vested Individual Account for purposes of this
paragraph will be determined by including rollover contributions (and earnings allocable thereto) within the meaning of Code
sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3)(a)(ii), and 457(e)(16). If rollovers were previously included in determining the value of
the Participant’s Vested Individual Account for purposes of this paragraph, any Adoption Agreement election to exclude rollovers
L
will be effective prospectively as of the date the Adoption Agreement was amended.
2. Individual Account Balances Exceeding Cashout Level – If distribution in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity is
required with respect to a Participant and either the value of the Participant’s Vested Individual Account exceeds the cashout level or
there are remaining payments to be made with respect to a particular distribution option that previously commenced, and if the
Individual Account is immediately distributable, the Participant must consent to any distribution of such Individual Account.
P
If distribution in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity is not required with respect to a Participant and the value of
such Participant’s Vested Individual Account exceeds the cashout level, and if the Individual Account is immediately
distributable, the Participant must consent to any distribution of such Individual Account.
The consent of the Participant and the Participant’s Spouse will be obtained (either in writing or in any other form permitted
under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) within the 180-day period ending on the Annuity Starting Date. The Plan
Administrator shall notify the Participant and the Participant’s Spouse of the right to defer any distribution until the Participant’s
Individual Account is no longer immediately distributable and, for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2006, the
M
consequences of failing to defer any distribution. Such notification will include a general description of the material features, and
an explanation of the relative values of the optional forms of benefit available under the Plan in a manner that would satisfy the
notice requirements of Code section 417(a)(3), and a description of the consequences of failing to defer a distribution, and will
be provided no less than 30 days and no more than 180 days before the Annuity Starting Date.
If a distribution is one to which Code sections 401(a)(11) and 417 do not apply, such distribution may commence less than 30
days after the notice required in Treasury Regulation section 1.411(a)-11(c) is given, provided that:
a. the Plan Administrator clearly informs the Participant that the Participant has a right to a period of at least 30 days after
receiving the notice to consider the decision of whether or not to elect a distribution (and, if applicable, a particular
Adistribution option), and
b. the Participant, after receiving the notice, affirmatively elects a distribution.
Notwithstanding the preceding, only the Participant need consent to the commencement of a distribution that is either made in
the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or is made from a Plan that meets the Retirement Equity Act safe harbor rules
of Plan Section 5.10(E), while the Individual Account is immediately distributable. Neither the consent of the Participant nor the
Participant’s Spouse will be required to the extent that a distribution is required to satisfy Code section 401(a)(9) or Code section
S415. In addition, upon termination of this Plan, if the Plan does not offer an annuity option (purchased from a commercial
provider), the Participant’s Individual Account may, without the Participant’s consent, be distributed to the Participant or
transferred to another defined contribution plan (other than an employee stock ownership plan as defined in Code section
4975(e)(7)) within the same controlled group.
An Individual Account is immediately distributable if any part of the Individual Account could be distributed to the Participant
(or surviving Spouse) before the Participant attains or would have attained (if not deceased) the later of Normal Retirement Age
or age 62.
3. Distribution Before Attainment of Normal Retirement Age – Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, a Participant
who has incurred a Termination of Employment before attaining Normal Retirement Age may elect to receive a distribution of
Matching Contributions, Employer Profit Sharing Contributions, and Employer Money Purchase Pension Contributions, as
applicable. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, a Participant who has incurred a Severance from Employment
before attaining Normal Retirement Age may elect to receive a distribution with regard to Qualified Matching Contributions,
Elective Deferrals, and Qualified Nonelective Contributions, and the Vested portions of ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions and
QACA ADP Test Safe Harbor Contributions.
C. Distributions During Employment
1. In-Service Distributions – Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, if this is a profit sharing plan, a Participant who is
not otherwise eligible to receive a distribution of their Individual Account may elect to receive an in-service distribution of all or
part of the Vested portion of their Individual Account attributable to Employer Contributions, other than those described in Plan
Sections 5.01(A)(2) and 5.01(C)(2)(b), upon meeting one of the following requirements.
a. Participant for Five or More Years – An Employee who has been a Participant in the Plan for five or more years may
withdraw up to the entire Vested portion of their Individual Account.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 51 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 57]
b. Participant for Less than Five Years – An Employee who has been a Participant in the Plan for less than five years may
withdraw only the amount that has been in their Individual Account attributable to Employer Contributions for at least two
full Plan Years, measured from the date such contributions were allocated.
If elected in the Adoption Agreement, a Participant in a money purchase pension plan who is not otherwise eligible to receive a
distribution of their Individual Account may take a distribution of all or a part of their Individual Account when they reach age 62.
E
If the Plan is a profit sharing plan, a Participant who is not otherwise eligible to receive a distribution of their Individual Account
may elect to receive an in-service distribution of all or part of the Vested portion of their Individual Account attributable to
transfers of money purchase pension contributions when they are eligible to receive an in-service distribution of any Employer
Contributions under the Plan. Notwithstanding the forgoing, if any Employer Contributions are available for an in-service
distribution prior to age 62, amounts attributable to transfers of money purchase pension contributions will be available for an
in-service distribution at age 62.
All in-service distributions are subject to the requirements of Plan SLection 5.10, as applicable.
2. Hardship Withdrawals
a. Hardship Withdrawals of Matching Contributions and Employer Profit Sharing Contributions – Unless otherwise elected in the
Adoption Agreement, if this is a profit sharing plan, then notwithstanding Plan Section 5.01(C)(1), an Employee may elect to
receive a hardship distribution of all or part of the Vested portion of their Individual Account attributable to Employer
Contributions other than those describePd in Plan Section 5.01(A)(2), subject to the requirements of Plan Section 5.10.
For purposes of this Plan Section 5.01(C)(2)(a), hardship is defined as an immediate and heavy financial need of the Employee
where such Employee lacks other available resources. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, financial needs
considered immediate and heavy include, but are not limited to, 1) expenses incurred or necessary for medical care, described
in Code section 213(d), of the Employee, the Employee’s Spouse, dependents, or, if elected, the Employee’s Primary Beneficiary,
2) the purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a principal residence for the Employee, 3) payment of tuition and related
educational fees for the next 12 months of post-secondary education for the Employee, the Employee’s Spouse, children,
dependentMs, or, if elected, the Employee’s Primary Beneficiary, 4) payment to prevent the eviction of the Employee from, or a
foreclosure on the mortgage of, the Employee’s principal residence, 5), funeral or burial expenses for the Employee’s deceased
parent, Spouse, child, dependent, or, if elected, the Employee’s Primary Beneficiary, and 6) payment to repair damage to the
Employee’s principal residence that would qualify for a casualty loss deduction under Code section 165 (determined without
regard to whether the loss exceeds ten-percent of adjusted gross income).
A distribution will be considered necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need of the Employee only if
i. the Employee has obtained all distributions, other than hardship distributions, and all nontaxable loans available under
all plans maintained by the Employer; and
A
ii. the distribution is not in excess of the amount of an immediate and heavy financial need (including amounts necessary to
pay any federal, state, or local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution).
b. Hardship Withdrawals of Elective Deferrals – Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, distribution of Elective
Deferrals (including Qualified Nonelective Contributions and Qualified Matching Contributions that are treated as Elective
Deferrals and any earnings credited to an Employee’s account as of the later of December 31, 1988, and the end of the last
Plan Year ending before July 1, 1989) may be made to an Employee in the event of hardship. For the purposes of this Plan
Section 5.01(C)(2)(b), hardship is defined as an immediate and heavy financial need of the Employee where the distribution is
S
needed to satisfy the immediate and heavy financial need of such Employee. Hardship distributions are subject to the spousal
consent requirements contained in Code sections 401(a)(11) and 417, if applicable.
For purposes of determining whether an Employee has a hardship, rules similar to those described in Plan Section
5.01(C)(2)(a) will apply except that only the financial needs listed above will be considered. In addition, a distribution will be
considered as necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need of the Employee only if
i. all plans maintained by the Employer provide that the Employee’s Elective Deferrals (and Nondeductible Employee
Contributions) will be suspended for six months (12 months for hardship distributions before 2002) after the receipt of
the hardship distribution; and
ii. for hardship distributions before 2002, all plans maintained by the Employer provide that the Employee may not make
Elective Deferrals for the Employee’s taxable year immediately following the taxable year of the hardship distribution
in excess of the applicable limit under Code section 402(g) for such taxable year less the amount of such Employee’s
Elective Deferrals for the taxable year of the hardship distribution.
3. Qualified Reservist Distributions – Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, Participants may take penalty-free
qualified reservist distributions from the Plan. A qualified reservist distribution means any distribution to a Participant where
1) such distribution is made from Elective Deferrals, 2) such Participant was ordered or called to active duty for a period in excess
of 179 days or for an indefinite period, and 3) such distribution is made during the period beginning on the date of such order
or call and ending at the close of the active duty period. The Participant must have been ordered or called to active duty after
September 11, 2001.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 52 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 58]
D. Miscellaneous Distribution Issues
1. Distribution of Rollover, Transfer, and Nondeductible Employee Contributions – The following rules will apply with respect to
entitlement to distribution of rollover, transfer, and Nondeductible Employee Contributions.
a. Entitlement to Distribution –
i. Rollover Contributions – Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption AgreemeEnt, rollover contributions (including
rollovers of Nondeductible Employee Contributions) and earnings thereon may be distributed at any time upon
request. If the Adopting Employer specifies in the Adoption Agreement that Rollover contributions may not be
distributed at any time, such contributions will be subject to the Plan’s provisions governing distributions of either
Employer Profit Sharing Contributions (if this Plan is a profit sharing plan) or Employer Money Purchase Pension
Contributions (if this Plan is a money purchase pension plan).
ii. Elective Transfers – Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, elective transfer contributions may be
distributed at any time upon request subject to the restricLtions below and any other restrictions required by either the
Code or applicable regulations. If the Adopting Employer elects in the Adoption Agreement that elective transfer
contributions may not be distributed at any time, such contributions will be subject to the Plan’s provisions governing
distributions of either Employer Profit Sharing Contributions (if this Plan is a profit sharing plan) or Employer Money
Purchase Pension Contributions (if the Plan is a money purchase pension plan).
iii. Non-Elective Transfers – Each type of contribution (e.g., Elective Deferral, Employer Matching) included in non-elective
P
transfer contributions received by the Plan as a result of a merger, consolidation, spin-off, or other Employer-initiated
event will be distributable pursuant to the Plan’s provisions governing distributions of the same contribution type,
subject to the provisions of Code section 411(d)(6). If one or more contribution type does not exist under the Plan,
such contributions will be subject to the Plan’s provisions governing distributions of either Employer Profit Sharing
Contributions (if this Plan is a profit sharing plan) or Employer Money Purchase Pension Contributions (if this Plan is a
money purchase pension plan).
Notwithstanding the preceding, if rollover contributions, elective transfer contributions, or non-elective transfers are not
M
distributable at any time because either 1) no distribution options are selected for Employer Profit Sharing Contributions or
Employer Profit Sharing Contributions are not allowed in the Adoption Agreement (if the Plan is a profit sharing plan) or
2) no distribution options are selected for Employer Money Purchase Pension Plan Contributions or Employer Money
Purchase Pension Plan Contributions are not allowed in the Adoption Agreement (if the Plan is a Money Purchase Pension
Plan), then such contributions may be distributed upon 1) the Participant’s Termination of Employment, 2) the termination
of the Plan, or 3) if the Plan designates an Early Retirement Age, the Participant’s Termination of Employment after
satisfying any Early Retirement Age. If a Participant separates from service before satisfying the Early Retirement Age
requirement, but has satisfied the service requirement, the Participant will be entitled to elect an early retirement benefit
upon satisfying such age requirement.
A
To the extent that any optional form of benefit under this Plan permits a distribution before the Employee’s retirement, death,
Disability, attainment of Normal Retirement Age, or Termination of Employment, or before Plan termination, the optional form
of benefit is not available with respect to benefits attributable to assets (including the post-transfer earnings thereon) and
liabilities that are transferred (within the meaning of Code section 414(l)) to this Plan from a money purchase pension plan or a
target benefit pension plan qualified under Code section 401(a) (other than any portion of those assets and liabilities
attributable to voluntary employee contributions). In addition, unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, if such
transfers consist of Elective Deferrals or amounts treated as Elective Deferrals (including earnings thereon) from a 401(k) plan,
Sthe assets transferred will continue to be subject to the distribution restrictions under Code sections 401(k)(2) and 401(k)(10).
A Participant may at any time, and upon a request submitted to the Plan Administrator (either in writing or in any other
form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL), withdraw an amount from their Individual Account
attributable to Nondeductible Employee Contributions (including earnings thereon). In the event the portion of a
Participant’s Individual Account attributable to Nondeductible Employee Contributions experiences a loss such that the
amount remaining in such subaccount is less than the amount of Nondeductible Employee Contributions made by the
Participant, the maximum amount which the Participant may withdraw is an amount equal to the remaining portion of the
Participant’s Individual Account attributable to Nondeductible Employee Contributions. Subject to Plan Section 5.10, Joint
and Survivor Annuity Requirements (if applicable), the Participant may withdraw any part of the Deductible Employee
Contribution account by delivering an application (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated
by the IRS and DOL) to the Plan Administrator.
b. Direct Rollovers of Eligible Rollover Distributions – Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would
otherwise limit a Recipient’s election under this Plan Section 5.01(D)(1)(b), a Recipient may elect, at the time and in the
manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator, to have any portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution that is equal to at
least $500 (or such lesser amount if the Plan Administrator permits in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner) paid
directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Recipient in a Direct Rollover.
2. Option to Limit Frequency of In-Service Distributions – If this is a profit sharing plan and the Adopting Employer has elected to limit
the number of in-service distributions in the Adoption Agreement, then a Participant will be permitted only the number of in-service
distributions indicated in the Adoption Agreement during the course of such Participant’s employment with the Employer. The
amount that the Participant can withdraw will be limited to the lesser of the amount determined under the limits set forth in Plan
Section 5.01(C) or the percentage of the Participant’s Individual Account specified by the Adopting Employer in the Adoption
Agreement. Distributions under this Plan Section 5.01(D)(2) will be subject to the requirements of Plan Section 5.10.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 53 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 59]
3. Commencement of Benefits – Notwithstanding any other provision, unless the Participant elects otherwise, distribution of
benefits will begin no later than the 60th day after the latest of the close of the Plan Year in which
a. the Participant attains age 65 (or Normal Retirement Age, if earlier),
b. the Participant reaches the 10th anniversary of the year in which the Participant commenced participation in the Plan, or
E
c. the Participant incurs a Termination of Employment.
Notwithstanding the preceding, the failure of a Participant (and Spouse, if applicable) to consent to a distribution while a benefit
is immediately distributable, within the meaning of Plan Section 5.01(B)(2), will be deemed to be an election to defer
commencement of payment of any benefit sufficient to satisfy this Plan Section 5.01(D)(3).
4. Federally Declared Disaster – If allowed by the Employer, Participants may have previously requested or may in the future
request a distribution of, or a loan from, the Vested portion of their Individual Account balance related to federally declared
disaster area tax relief (e.g., Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and AirwLay Extension Act of 2017), and as allowed under the Code
and any additional rules, regulations, or other pronouncements promulgated by either the IRS or DOL.
5.02 FORM OF DISTRIBUTION TO A PARTICIPANT
Unless otherwise specified in the Adoption Agreement, if the value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account exceeds $1,000
and the Participant has properly waived the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (if applicable), as described in Plan Section 5.10, the
Participant may request (either in writing or in any otherP form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) that the Vested portion
of their Individual Account be paid to them in one or more of the following forms of payment: 1) in a lump sum, 2) in a non-recurring partial
payment, 3) in installment payments (a series of regularly scheduled recurring partial payments), or 4) applied to the purchase of an annuity
contract. Notwithstanding the preceding, Qualifying Longevity Annuity Contracts may be distributed in any manner allowed under the Code or
Treasury Regulations. In addition, non-recurring partial payments may be made from the Plan either before Termination of Employment or to
satisfy the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9).
5.03 DISTRIBUTIONS UPON THE DEATH OF A PARTICIPANT
M
A. Designation of Beneficiary – Spousal Consent – Each Participant may designate, in a form or manner approved by and delivered to
the Plan Administrator, one or more primary and contingent Beneficiaries to receive all or a specified portion of the Participant’s
Individual Account in the event of the Participant’s death. A Participant may change or revoke such Beneficiary designation by
completing and delivering the proper form to the Plan Administrator.
In the event that a Participant wishes to designate a Primary Beneficiary who is not their Spouse, their Spouse must consent (either in
writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to such designation, and the Spouse’s consent must
acknowledge the effect of such designation and be witnessed by a notary public or plan representative. Notwithstanding this consent
requirement, if the Participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Plan Administrator that such consent may not be obtained because
Athere is no Spouse or the Spouse cannot be located, no consent will be required. In addition, if the Spouse is legally incompetent to give
consent, the Spouse’s legal guardian, even if the guardian is the Participant, may give consent. If the Participant is legally separated or the
Participant has been abandoned (within the meaning of local law) and the Participant has a court order to such effect, spousal consent is
not required unless a Qualified Domestic Relations Order provides otherwise. Any change of Beneficiary will require a new spousal
consent to the extent required by the Code or Treasury Regulations.
B. Payment to Beneficiary – If a Participant dies before the Participant’s entire Individual Account has been paid to them, such
deceased Participant’s Individual Account will be payable to any surviving Beneficiary designated by the Participant, or, if no
S
Beneficiary survives the Participant, to the Participant’s Spouse, or, where no Spouse exists, to the Participant’s estate. If the
Beneficiary is a minor, distribution will be deemed to have been made to such Beneficiary if the portion of the Participant’s Individual
Account to which the Beneficiary is entitled is paid to their legal guardian or, if applicable, to their custodian under the Uniform Gifts
to Minors Act or the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. If a Beneficiary is not a minor but is not legally competent to request or consent
to a distribution, distributions will be deemed to have been made to such Beneficiary if the portion of the Participant’s Individual
Account to which the Beneficiary is entitled is paid to the Participant’s court-appointed guardian, an attorney-in-fact acting under a
valid power of attorney, or any other individual or entity authorized under state law to act on behalf of the Beneficiary. A Beneficiary
may disclaim their portion of a Participant’s Individual Account by providing the Plan Administrator written notification pursuant to
Code section 2518(b).
C. Distribution Request – When Distributed – A Beneficiary of a deceased Participant entitled to a distribution who wishes to receive a
distribution must submit a request (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the
Plan Administrator. If required in writing, such request will be made on a form provided or approved by the Plan Administrator. Unless
otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, upon a valid request, the Plan Administrator shall direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if
applicable) to commence distribution as soon as administratively feasible after the request is received.
5.04 FORM OF DISTRIBUTION TO BENEFICIARIES
A. Value of Individual Account Does Not Exceed $5,000 – If the value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account does
not exceed $5,000, the value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account may be made to the Beneficiary in a single
lump sum in lieu of all other forms of distribution under the Plan, as soon as administratively feasible.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 54 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 60]
Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, the value of the Participant’s Vested Individual Account for purposes of this
paragraph will be determined by including rollover contributions (and earnings allocable thereto) within the meaning of Code
sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3)(A)(ii), and 457(e)(16).
B. Value of Individual Account Exceeds $5,000 – If the value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account exceeds
$5,000, the preretirement survivor annuity requirements of Plan Section 5.10 will apply unless waived in accordance with that Plan
Section 5.10 or unless the Retirement Equity Act safe harbor rules of Plan Section 5.10(E) aEpply. However, a surviving Spouse
Beneficiary may elect any form of payment allowable under the Plan in lieu of the preretirement survivor annuity. Any such payment
to the surviving Spouse must meet the requirements of Plan Section 5.05.
If the value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account exceeds $5,000 and either (1) the preretirement survivor
annuity requirements of Plan Section 5.10 have been satisfied or waived in accordance or (2) the Retirement Equity Act safe harbor
rules of Plan Section 5.10(E) apply, the value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account may be made to the
Beneficiary in a single lump sum in lieu of all other forms of distribution under the Plan, as soon as administratively feasible.
L
C. Other Forms of Distribution to Beneficiary – If the value of a Participant’s Individual Account exceeds $5,000 and the Participant
has properly waived the preretirement survivor annuity, as described in Plan Section 5.10 (if applicable), or if the Beneficiary is the
Participant’s surviving Spouse, the Beneficiary may, subject to the requirements of Plan Section 5.05, request (either in writing or in
any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) that the Participant’s Individual Account be paid in any form
of distribution permitted to be taken by the Participant under this Plan other than applying the Individual Account toward the
purchase of an annuity contract. NotwithstandingP the preceding, installment payments to a Beneficiary cannot be made over a period
exceeding the Life Expectancy of such Beneficiary.
Notwithstanding the preceding provisions, a Beneficiary is permitted (subject to regulatory guidance) to directly roll over their portion of
the Individual Account to an inherited individual retirement arrangement (under Code sections 408 or 408A). Such Direct Rollovers must
otherwise qualify as Eligible Rollover Distributions.
5.05 REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS
M
A. General Rules
1. Subject to Plan Section 5.10, the requirements of this Plan Section 5.05 will apply to any distribution of a Participant’s interest
and will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of this Plan. Unless otherwise specified, the provisions of this Plan
Section 5.05 apply to calendar years beginning after December 31, 2002.
2. All distributions required under this Plan Section 5.05 will be determined and made in accordance with Treasury Regulation
section 1.401(a)(9), including the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of Code section 401(a)(9)(G).
3. Limits on Distribution Periods – As of the first Distribution Calendar Year, distributions to a Participant, if not made in a single
Asum, may only be made over one of the following periods (or a combination thereof):
a. the life of the Participant,
b. the joint lives of the Participant and a Designated Beneficiary,
c. a period certain not extending beyond the Life Expectancy of the Participant, or
d. a period certain not extending beyond the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the Participant and a Designated
Beneficiary.
S
B. Time and Manner of Distribution
1. Required Beginning Date – The Participant’s entire interest, less any amount held in a Qualifying Longevity Annuity Contract, will
be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the Participant no later than the Participant’s Required Beginning Date.
For purposes of this Plan Section 5.05(B) and Plan Section 5.05(D), unless Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(iii) applies, distributions are
considered to begin on the Participant’s Required Beginning Date. If Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(iii) applies, distributions are
considered to begin on the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving Spouse under Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(i). If
distributions under an annuity purchased from an insurance company irrevocably commence to the Participant before the
Participant’s Required Beginning Date (or to the Participant’s surviving Spouse before the date distributions are required to
begin to the surviving Spouse in Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(i)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date
distributions actually commence.
Except as provided in the Adoption Agreement (or in a separate IRS model amendment, if applicable), Participants or
Beneficiaries may elect on an individual basis whether the five-year rule or the life expectancy rule in Plan Section 5.05(D) applies
to distributions after the death of a Participant who has a Designated Beneficiary. The election must be made no later than the
earlier of September 30 of the calendar year in which distribution would be required to begin under this Plan Section 5.05(B), or
by September 30 of the calendar year that contains the fifth anniversary of the Participant’s (or, if applicable, surviving Spouse’s)
death. If neither the Participant nor the Beneficiary makes an election under this paragraph, distributions will be made in
accordance with this Plan Section 5.05(B) and Plan Section 5.05(D) and, if applicable, the election in the Adoption Agreement (or
in a separate IRS model amendment, if applicable).

[PAGE 61]
2. Forms of Distribution – Unless the Participant’s interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance
company or in a single sum on or before the Required Beginning Date, as of the first Distribution Calendar Year distributions will
be made in accordance with Plan Section 5.05(C) and Plan Section 5.05(D). If the Participant’s interest is distributed in the form
of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements
of Code section 401(a)(9) and the corresponding Treasury Regulations.
C. Required Minimum Distributions During Participant’s Lifetime E
1. Amount of Required Minimum Distribution for Each Distribution Calendar Year – During the Participant’s lifetime, the minimum
amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year is the lesser of:
a. the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant’s Benefit by the distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth
in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-9, Q&A 2, using the Participant’s age as of the Participant’s birthday in the
Distribution Calendar Year; or
L
b. if the Participant’s sole Designated Beneficiary for the Distribution Calendar Year is the Participant’s Spouse, the quotient
obtained by dividing the Participant’s Benefit by the number in the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Treasury
Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-9, Q&A 3, using the Participant’s and Spouse’s attained ages as of the Participant’s and
Spouse’s birthdays in the Distribution Calendar Year.
Additionally, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year will also include any payments
from a Qualifying Longevity Annuity ContracPt where payments have commenced.
2. Lifetime Required Minimum Distributions Continue Through Year of Participant’s Death – Required minimum distributions will
be determined under this Plan Section 5.05(C) beginning with the first Distribution Calendar Year and up to and including the
Distribution Calendar Year that includes the Participant’s date of death.
D. Required Minimum Distributions After Participant’s Death
1. Death On or After Date Distributions Begin
M
a. Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary – If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is a
Designated Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of
the Participant’s death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant’s benefit by the longer of the remaining Life
Expectancy of the Participant or the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant’s Designated Beneficiary, determined as
follows:
i. The Participant’s remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced
by one for each subsequent year.
ii. If the Participant’s surviving Spouse is the Participant’s sole Designated Beneficiary, the remaining Life Expectancy of
A
the surviving Spouse is calculated for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant’s death using
the surviving Spouse’s age as of the Spouse’s birthday in that year. For Distribution Calendar Years after the year of
the surviving Spouse’s death, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving Spouse is calculated using the age of the
surviving Spouse as of the Spouse’s birthday in the calendar year of the Spouse’s death, reduced by one for each
subsequent calendar year.
iii. If the Participant’s surviving Spouse is not the Participant’s sole Designated Beneficiary, the Designated Beneficiary’s
remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Designated Beneficiary in the year following the year of
S
the Participant’s death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
b. No Designated Beneficiary – If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is no Designated
Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year after the year of the Participant’s death, the minimum amount that will be
distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant’s death is the quotient obtained by dividing
the Participant’s benefit by the Participant’s remaining Life Expectancy calculated using the age of the Participant in the
year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
2. Death Before Date Distributions Begin
a. Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary – Except as provided in the Adoption Agreement (or in a separate IRS model
amendment, if applicable) or as elected by a Designated Beneficiary pursuant to Plan Section 5.05(B)(1), if the Participant
dies before the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed
for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant’s death is the quotient obtained by dividing the
Participant’s benefit by the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant’s Designated Beneficiary, determined as provided in
Plan Section 5.05(D)(1).
i. If the Participant’s surviving Spouse is the Participant’s sole Designated Beneficiary, then, except as provided in the
Adoption Agreement (or in a separate IRS model amendment, if applicable), distributions to the surviving Spouse will
begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died, or by
December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70½, if later.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 56 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 62]
ii. If the Participant’s surviving Spouse is not the Participant’s sole Designated Beneficiary, then, except as provided in the
Adoption Agreement (or in a separate IRS model amendment, if applicable), distributions to the Designated
Beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the
Participant died.
iii. If the Participant’s surviving Spouse is the Participant’s sole Designated Beneficiary and the surviving Spouse dies after
the Participant but before distributions to the surviving Spouse are requiredE to begin, this Plan Section 5.05(D)(2),
other than Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a), will apply as if the surviving Spouse were the Participant.
b. No Designated Beneficiary – If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no Designated
Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant’s death, distribution of the Participant’s
entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant’s
death.
3. Election to Allow Designated Beneficiary Receiving Distributions UndLer Five-Year Rule to Elect Life Expectancy Distributions – Unless
specified otherwise in a separate IRS model amendment, a Designated Beneficiary who is receiving payments under the five-year rule
may have made a new election to receive payments under the life expectancy rule until December 31, 2003, provided that all amounts
that would have been required to be distributed under the life expectancy rule for all distribution calendar years before 2004 are
distributed by the earlier of December 31, 2003 or the end of the five-year period.
4. Qualifying Longevity Annuity Contract – After the death of the Participant, payments from a Qualifying Longevity Annuity Contract
P
must start or continue to be made to the Designated Beneficiary according to the terms of the Qualifying Longevity Annuity Contract.
E. TEFRA Section 242(b) Elections
1. Notwithstanding the other requirements of this Plan Section 5.05 and subject to the requirements of Plan Section 5.10, Joint and
Survivor Annuity Requirements, distribution on behalf of any Employee (or former Employee), including a five-percent owner, who
has made a designation under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 Section 242(b)(2) (a “Section 242(b)(2) Election”)
may be made in accordance with all of the following requirements (regardless of when such distribution commences).
M
a. The distribution by the Fund is one which would not have qualified such Fund under Code section 401(a)(9) as in effect
before amendment by the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984.
b. The distribution is in accordance with a method of distribution designated by the Employee whose interest in the Fund is
being distributed or, if the Employee is deceased, by a Beneficiary of such Employee.
c. Such designation was in writing, was signed by the Employee or the Beneficiary, and was made before January 1, 1984.
d. The Employee had accrued a benefit under the Plan as of December 31, 1983.
e. The method of distribution designated by the Employee or the Beneficiary specifies the time at which distribution will
A
commence, the period over which distributions will be made, and in the case of any distribution upon the Employee’s
death, the Beneficiaries of the Employee listed in order of priority.
2. A distribution upon death will not be covered by this transitional rule unless the information in the designation contains the
required information described above with respect to the distributions to be made upon the death of the Employee.
3. If a designation is revoked, any subsequent distribution must satisfy the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9) and the
corresponding regulations. If a designation is revoked subsequent to the date distributions are required to begin, the Plan must
Sdistribute, by the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the revocation occurs, the total amount not yet
distributed which would have been required to have been distributed to satisfy Code section 401(a)(9) and the corresponding
regulations, but for an election made under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, Section 242(b)(2). For calendar
years beginning after December 31, 1988, such distributions must meet the minimum distribution incidental benefit
requirements. Any changes in the designation will be considered to be a revocation of the designation. However, the mere
substitution or addition of another Beneficiary (one not named in the designation) under the designation will not be considered
to be a revocation of the designation, provided such substitution or addition does not alter the period over which distributions
are to be made under the designation, directly or indirectly (for example, by altering the relevant measuring life).
4. In the case in which an amount is transferred or rolled over from one plan to another plan, the rules in Treasury Regulation
section 1.401(a)(9)-8, Q&A 14 and Q&A 15, will apply.
F. Transition Rules – For plans in existence before 2003, required minimum distributions before 2003 were made pursuant to Plan
Section 5.05(E), if applicable, and Plan Sections 5.05(F)(1) through 5.05(F)(3) below.
1. 2000 and Before – Required minimum distributions for calendar years after 1984 and before 2001 were made in accordance with
Code section 401(a)(9) and the corresponding Proposed Treasury Regulations published in the Federal Register on July 27, 1987
(the “1987 Proposed Regulations”).
2. 2001 – Required minimum distributions for calendar year 2001 were made in accordance with Code section 401(a)(9) and the
Proposed Treasury Regulations in Section 401(a)(9) as published in the Federal Register on January 17, 2001 (the “2001 Proposed
Regulations”) unless a prior IRS model amendment provision was adopted that stated that the required minimum distributions
for 2001 were made pursuant to the 1987 Proposed Regulations. If distributions were made in 2001 under the 1987 Proposed
Regulations before the date in 2001 that the Plan began operating under the 2001 Proposed Regulations, the special transition
rule in Announcement 2001-82, 2001-2 C.B. 123, applied.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 57 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 63]
3. 2002 – Required minimum distributions for calendar year 2002 were made in accordance with Code section 401(a)(9) and the
2001 Proposed Regulations unless the prior IRS model amendment, if applicable, provided that either a. or b. below applies.
a. Required minimum distributions for 2002 were made pursuant to the 1987 Proposed Regulations.
b. Required minimum distributions for 2002 were made pursuant to the Final and Temporary Treasury Regulations under
Code section 401(a)(9) published in the Federal Register on April 17, 2002 (the “2E002 Final and Temporary Regulations”),
which are described in Plan Sections 5.05(B) through 5.05(E). If distributions were made in 2002 under either the 1987
Proposed Regulations or the 2001 Proposed Regulations before the date in 2002 on which the Plan began operating under
the 2002 Final and Temporary Regulations, the special transition rule in Section 1.2 of the model amendment in Revenue
Procedure 2002-29, 2002-1 C.B. 1176, applied.
5.06 ANNUITY CONTRACTS
Any annuity contract distributed under the Plan (if permitted or required by this Plan Section Five) must be nontransferable. The terms of
L
any annuity contract purchased and distributed by the Plan to a Participant or Spouse will comply with the requirements of the Plan.
5.07 DISTRIBUTIONS IN-KIND
The Plan Administrator may, but need not, cause any distribution under this Plan to be made either in a form actually held in the Fund, or in
cash by converting assets other than cash into cash, or in any combination of the two preceding methods. Assets other than cash, or other
assets with a readily ascertainable market value, must be subject to a third-party appraisal before they may be distributed from the Plan.
P
5.08 PROCEDURE FOR MISSING PARTICIPANTS OR BENEFICIARIES
The Plan Administrator must use all reasonable measures to locate Participants or Beneficiaries who are entitled to distributions from the
Plan. Such measures may include using certified mail, checking records of other plans maintained by the Employer, contacting the
Participant’s Beneficiaries, using a governmental letter-forwarding service, or using internet search tools, commercial locator services, and
credit reporting agencies. The Plan Administrator should consider the cost of the measures relative to the Individual Account balance when
determining which measures are used.
In the event that the Plan AMdministrator cannot locate a Participant or Beneficiary who is entitled to a distribution from the Plan after using all
reasonable measures, the Plan Administrator may, consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and other pronouncements under the Code and
ERISA, use any reasonable procedure to dispose of distributable Plan assets, including any of the following: 1) establish an individual
retirement arrangement (IRA), under Code section 408, that complies with the automatic rollover safe harbor regulations, without regard to the
amount in the Individual Account, 2) establish a federally insured bank account for and in the name of the Participant or Beneficiary and
transfer the assets to such bank account, 3) purchase an annuity contract with the assets in the name of the Participant or Beneficiary (unless
an annuity form of distribution is prohibited under the Plan), 4) transfer the assets to the unclaimed property fund of the state in which the
Participant or Beneficiary was last known to reside, or 5) after the expiration of five years after the benefit becomes payable, treat the amount
distributable as a Forfeiture and allocate it in accordance with the terms of the Plan, and if the Participant or Beneficiary is later located, restore
suchA benefit in the amount of the Forfeiture, unadjusted for earnings and losses to the Plan.
In the event the Plan is terminated, payments must be made in a manner that protects the benefit rights of a Participant or Beneficiary.
Benefit rights will be deemed to be protected if the amount in a Participant’s or Beneficiary’s Individual Account is placed into an IRA, used
to purchase an annuity contract, or transferred to another qualified retirement plan. Benefit rights need not, however, be protected if an
Individual Account becomes subject to state escheat laws, or if a payment is made to satisfy Code section 401(a)(9), or if such other
process is followed that is consistent with applicable statutory or regulatory guidance.
S5.09 CLAIMS PROCEDURES
A. Filing a Claim for Plan Distributions – A Participant or Beneficiary who has been denied a request for a distribution or loan and desires
to make a claim for the Vested portion of the Participant’s Individual Account will file a request (either in writing or in any other form

protect or clarify their right to benefits under this Plan.
If the claim for a Plan distribution or loan involves disability benefits under the Plan, the Plan Administrator must furnish such
Participant or Beneficiary with notice of the denial within 45 days of the date the original claim was filed. In addition to satisfying the
general notice of denial requirements described above, the Plan Administrator must provide the Participant with 1) an explanation of
the basis for disagreeing or not following a) the views of the health professionals treating the Participant or vocational professionals
who evaluated the Participant, b) the views of the medical or vocational experts whose advice was obtained in connection with the

application for review by the Plan Administrator. The Participant or Beneficiary may request thEat the review be in the nature of a hearing.
The Participant or Beneficiary will have the right to representation, to review pertinent documents, and to submit comments in writing (or
in any other form permitted by the IRS or DOL). The Plan Administrator shall issue a decision on such review within 60 days after receipt
of an application for review as provided for in this Plan Section 5.09 and pursuant to Department of Labor regulation Section 2560.503-1.
If the claim involves disability benefits under the Plan, the Participant or Beneficiary will have 180 days from receipt of the denial notice in
which to make written application for review by the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall issue a decision on such review
within 45 days after receipt of an application for review as provided for in this Plan Section 5.09 and pursuant to Labor regulation Section
L
2560.503-1.
Upon a decision unfavorable to the Participant or Beneficiary, such Participant or Beneficiary will be entitled to bring such actions in law
or equity as may be necessary or appropriate to protect or clarify their right to benefits under this Plan. The Participant or Beneficiary will
have one year from receipt of the denial notice to bring such action.
5.10 JOINT AND SURVIVOR ANNUITY REQUIREMENTS
P
A. Application – The provisions of this Plan Section 5.10 will apply to any Participant who is credited with at least one Hour of Service
with the Employer on or after August 23, 1984, and such other Participants as provided in Treasury Regulations.
B. Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity – Unless an optional form of benefit is selected pursuant to a Qualified Election within the
180-day period ending on the Annuity Starting Date, a married Participant’s Vested Account Balance will be paid in the form of a
Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and an unmarried Participant’s Vested Account Balance will be paid in the form of a life annuity.
The Participant may elect to have such annuity distributed upon attainment of the Earliest Retirement Age under the Plan. In the case
M
of a married Participant, the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity must be at least as valuable as any other optional form of benefit
payable under the Plan at the same time.
A Plan that is subject to the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity requirements must offer an additional survivor annuity option in the
form of a Qualified Optional Survivor Annuity.
C. Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity – Unless an optional form of benefit has been selected within the Election Period
pursuant to a Qualified Election, if a Participant dies before the Annuity Starting Date then the Participant’s Vested Account Balance
will be applied toward the purchase of an annuity for the life of the surviving Spouse. The surviving Spouse may elect to have such
annuity distributed within a reasonable period after the Participant’s death.
A
D. Notice Requirements
1. In the case of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, the Plan Administrator shall no less than 30 days and not more than 180 days
before the Annuity Starting Date provide each Participant an explanation (either in writing or in any other form permitted under
rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) of 1) the terms and conditions of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, 2) the Participant’s
right to make and the effect of an election to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity form of benefit, 3) the rights of a
Participant’s Spouse, and 4) the right to make, and the effect of, a revocation of a previous election to waive the Qualified Joint and
SSurvivor Annuity. The written explanation shall comply with the requirements of Treasury Regulation section 1.417(a)(3)-1.
The Annuity Starting Date for a distribution in a form other than a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity may be less than 30 days
after receipt of the explanation described in the preceding paragraph provided 1) the Participant has been provided with
information that clearly indicates that the Participant has at least 30 days to consider whether to waive the Qualified Joint and
Survivor Annuity and elect (with spousal consent) a form of distribution other than a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, 2) the
Participant is permitted to revoke any affirmative distribution election at least until the annuity starting date or, if later, at any
time before the expiration of the seven-day period that begins the day after the explanation of the Qualified Joint and Survivor
Annuity is provided to the Participant, and 3) the annuity starting date is a date after the date that the explanation was provided
to the Participant.
2. In the case of a Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity as described in Plan Section 5.10(C), the Plan Administrator shall
provide each Participant within the applicable period for such Participant an explanation (either in writing or in any other form
permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) of the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity in such terms and in
such manner as would be comparable to the explanation provided for meeting the requirements of Plan Section 5.10(D)(1)
applicable to a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity. The written explanation shall comply with the requirements of Treasury
Regulation section 1.417(a)(3)-1.
The applicable period for a Participant is whichever of the following periods ends last: 1) the period beginning with the first day of
the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age 32 and ending with the close of the Plan Year preceding the Plan Year in which the
Participant attains age 35, 2) a reasonable period ending after the individual becomes a Participant, 3) a reasonable period ending
after Plan Section 5.10(D)(3) ceases to apply to the Participant, and 4) a reasonable period ending after this Plan Section 5.10 first
applies to the Participant. Notwithstanding the preceding, notice must be provided within a reasonable period ending after
separation from service in the case of a Participant who separates from service before attaining age 35.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 59 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 65]
For purposes of applying the preceding paragraph, a reasonable period ending after the enumerated events described in 2),
3) and 4) is the end of the two-year period beginning one year before the date the applicable event occurs, and ending one year
after that date. In the case of a Participant who separates from service before the Plan Year in which age 35 is attained, notice
will be provided within the two-year period beginning one year before separation and ending one year after separation. If such a
Participant thereafter returns to employment with the Employer, the applicable period for such Participant will be redetermined.
3. Notwithstanding the other requirements of this Plan Section 5.10(D), the respective nEotices prescribed by this Plan Section
5.10(D) need not be given to a Participant if 1) the Plan “fully subsidizes” the costs of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or
Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity, and 2) the Plan does not allow the Participant to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor
Annuity or Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity and does not allow a married Participant to designate a non-Spouse
Beneficiary. For purposes of this Plan Section 5.10(D)(3), a plan fully subsidizes the costs of a benefit if no increase in cost or
decrease in benefits to the Participant may result from the Participant’s failure to elect another benefit.
E. Retirement Equity Act Safe Harbor Rules
L
1. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, the safe harbor provisions of this Plan Section 5.10(E) will apply to a
Participant in a profit sharing plan and will always apply to any distribution made on or after the first day of the first Plan Year
beginning after December 31, 1988, from or under a separate account attributable solely to accumulated deductible employee
contributions, as defined in Code section 72(o)(5)(B), and maintained on behalf of a Participant in a money purchase pension
plan, if the following conditions are satisfied:
P
a. the Participant does not or cannot elect payments in the form of a life annuity; and
b. on the death of a Participant, the Participant’s Vested Account Balance will be paid to the Participant’s surviving Spouse, but if
there is no surviving Spouse, or if the surviving Spouse has consented in a manner conforming to a Qualified Election, then to
the Participant’s Designated Beneficiary. The surviving Spouse may elect to have distribution of the Vested Account Balance
commence within the 180-day period following the date of the Participant’s death. The Vested Account Balance will be
adjusted for gains or losses occurring after the Participant’s death in accordance with the provisions of the Plan governing the
adjustment of account balances for other types of distributions. This Plan Section 5.10(E) will not apply to a Participant in a
M
profit sharing plan if the plan is a direct or indirect transferee of a defined benefit plan, money purchase pension plan, a target
benefit pension plan, stock bonus, or profit sharing plan that is subject to the survivor annuity requirements of Code sections
401(a)(11) and 417. If this Plan Section 5.10(E) applies, then no other provisions of this Plan Section 5.10 will apply except as
provided in Treasury Regulations.
2. The Participant may waive the spousal death benefit described in this Plan Section 5.10(E) at any time provided that no such
waiver will be effective unless it is a Qualified Election (other than the notification requirement referred to therein) that would
apply to the Participant’s waiver of the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity.
3. For purposes of this Plan Section 5.10(E), Vested Account Balance will mean, in the case of a money purchase pension plan, the
AParticipant’s separate account balance attributable solely to accumulated deductible employee contributions within the meaning
of Code section 72(o)(5)(B). In the case of a profit sharing plan, Vested Account Balance will have the same meaning as provided
in the Definitions Section of this Plan.
4. In the event this Plan is a direct or indirect transferee of or a restatement of a plan previously subject to the survivor annuity
requirements of Code sections 401(a)(11) and 417 and the Employer has selected to have this Plan Section 5.10(E) apply, the
provisions of this Plan Section 5.10(E) will not apply to any benefits accrued (including subsequent adjustments for earnings and
losses) before the adoption of these provisions. Such amounts will be separately accounted for in a manner consistent with Plan
S
Section 7.02 and administered in accordance with the general survivor annuity requirements of Plan Section 5.10.
5.11 LIABILITY FOR WITHHOLDING ON DISTRIBUTIONS
The Plan Administrator shall be responsible for withholding federal income taxes from distributions from the Plan, unless the Participant
(or Beneficiary, where applicable) elects not to have such taxes withheld. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) or other payor may act as
agent for the Plan Administrator to withhold such taxes and to make the appropriate distribution reports, provided the Plan Administrator
furnishes all the information to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) or other payor which such payor may need to properly perform
withholding and reporting.
5.12 DISTRIBUTION OF EXCESS ELECTIVE DEFERRALS
A. General Rule – A Participant may assign to this Plan any Excess Elective Deferrals made during a taxable year of the Participant by
notifying the Plan Administrator of the amount of the Excess Elective Deferrals to be assigned to the Plan. Unless otherwise elected in
the Adoption Agreement, Participants who claim Excess Elective Deferrals for the preceding calendar year must submit their claims
(either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Plan Administrator by March 1.
A Participant is deemed to notify the Plan Administrator of any Excess Elective Deferrals that arise by taking into account only those
Elective Deferrals made to this Plan and any other plan, contract, or arrangement of the Employer.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 60 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 66]
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, Excess Elective Deferrals, plus any income and minus any loss allocable thereto, will
be distributed no later than April 15th to any Participant to whose Individual Account Excess Elective Deferrals were assigned for the
preceding year and who claims Excess Elective Deferrals for such taxable year, except to the extent such Excess Elective Deferrals were
classified as Catch-up Contributions. The Plan Administrator, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, will determine whether the
distribution of Excess Elective Deferrals for a year will be made first from the Participant’s Pre-Tax Elective Deferral account or the
Roth Elective Deferral account, or a combination of both, to the extent both Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals
E
were made for the year, or may allow Participants to specify otherwise.
B. Determination of Income or Loss – Excess Elective Deferrals will be adjusted for any income or loss up to the end of the Plan Year
to which such contributions were allocated. The income or loss allocable to Excess Elective Deferrals is the income or loss allocable to
the Participant’s Elective Deferral account for the taxable year multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is such Participant’s
Excess Elective Deferrals for the year and the denominator of which is the Participant’s Individual Account balance attributable to
Elective Deferrals without regard to any income or loss occurring during such taxable year. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Plan
Administrator may compute the income or loss allocable to Excess ElectLive Deferrals in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B)
(i.e., the usual manner used by the Plan for allocating income or loss to Participants’ Individual Accounts or any reasonable method),
provided such method is used consistently for all Participants and for all corrective distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year. The
Plan will not fail to use a reasonable method for computing the income or loss on Excess Elective Deferrals merely because the
income allocable is based on a date that is no more than seven days before the distribution.
5.13 DISTRIBUTION OF EXCESS CONTRIBUTIONS
P
A. General Rule – Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, Excess Contributions, plus any income and minus any loss allocable
thereto, will be distributed no later than 12 months after a Plan Year to Participants to whose Individual Accounts such Excess
Contributions were allocated for such Plan Year, except to the extent such Excess Contributions were classified as Catch-up
Contributions. Excess Contributions are allocated to the Highly Compensated Employees with the largest amounts of Employer
Contributions taken into account in calculating the ADP test for the year in which the excess arose, beginning with the Highly
Compensated Employee with the largest amount of such Employer Contributions and continuing in descending order until all the
Excess Contributions have been allocated. Both the total amount of the Excess Contribution and, for purposes of the preceding
M
sentence, the “largest amount” are determined after distribution of any Excess Deferrals. To the extent a Highly Compensated
Employee has not reached their Catch-up Contribution limit under the Plan, Excess Contributions allocated to such Highly
Compensated Employees as Catch-up Contributions will not be treated as Excess Contributions. If such Excess Contributions are
distributed more than 2½ months (six months in the case of Excess Contributions under an EACA if all Employees who are eligible to
participate are affected as described in the Plan) after the last day of the Plan Year in which such Contributions were made, a ten-
percent excise tax will be imposed on the Employer maintaining the Plan with respect to such amounts. Excess Contributions will be
treated as annual additions under the Plan even if distributed.
B. Determination of Income or Loss – Excess Contributions will be adjusted for any income or loss up to the end of the Plan Year to
Awhich such contributions were allocated. The income or loss allocable to Excess Contributions allocated to each Participant is the
income or loss allocable to the Participant’s Elective Deferral account(s) (and, if applicable, the Qualified Nonelective Contribution
account or the Qualified Matching Contributions account or both) for the Plan Year multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
such Participant’s Excess Contributions for the year and the denominator of which is the Participant’s Individual Account balance
attributable to Elective Deferrals (and Qualified Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions, or both, if any of such
contributions are included in the ADP test) without regard to any income or loss occurring during such Plan Year. Notwithstanding
the preceding, the Plan Administrator may compute the income or loss allocable to Excess Contributions in the manner described in
Plan Section 7.02(B) (i.e., the usual manner used by the Plan for allocating income or loss to Participants’ Individual Accounts or any
S
reasonable method), provided such method is used consistently for all Participants and for all corrective distributions under the Plan
for the Plan Year. The Plan will not fail to use a reasonable method for computing the income or loss on Excess Contributions merely
because the income allocable is based on a date that is no more than seven days before the distribution.
C. Accounting for Excess Contributions – Excess Contributions allocated to a Participant will be distributed from the Participant’s
Elective Deferral account(s) and Qualified Matching Contribution account (if applicable) in proportion to the Participant’s Elective
Deferrals and Qualified Matching Contributions (to the extent used in the ADP test) for the Plan Year. The Plan Administrator, in a
uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, will either determine whether the distribution of Excess Contributions for a year will be made
first from the Participant’s Pre-Tax Elective Deferral account or the Roth Elective Deferral account, or a combination of both, to the
extent both Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals were made for the year, or may allow Participants to specify
otherwise. Excess Contributions will be distributed from the Participant’s Qualified Nonelective Contribution account only to the
extent that such Excess Contributions exceed the balance in the Participant’s Elective Deferral account(s) and Qualified Matching
Contribution account.

[PAGE 67]
5.14 DISTRIBUTION OF EXCESS AGGREGATE CONTRIBUTIONS
A. General Rule – Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, Excess Aggregate Contributions, plus any income and minus any
loss allocable thereto, will be forfeited, if forfeitable, or if not forfeitable, distributed no later than 12 months after a Plan Year to
Participants to whose accounts such Excess Aggregate Contributions were allocated for such Plan Year. Excess Aggregate
Contributions are allocated to the Highly Compensated Employees with the largest Contribution Percentage Amounts taken into
E
account in calculating the ACP test for the year in which the excess arose, beginning with the Highly Compensated Employee with the
largest amount of such Contribution Percentage Amounts and continuing in descending order until all the Excess Aggregate
Contributions have been allocated. If such Excess Aggregate Contributions are distributed more than 2½ months (six months in the
case of Excess Aggregate Contributions under an EACA if all Employees who are eligible to participate are affected as described in the
Plan) after the last day of the Plan Year in which such Excess Aggregate Contributions were made, a ten-percent excise tax will be
imposed on the Employer maintaining the Plan with respect to those amounts. Excess Aggregate Contributions will be treated as
annual additions under the Plan even if distributed.
L
B. Determination of Income or Loss – Excess Aggregate Contributions will be adjusted for any income or loss up to the end of the Plan
Year to which such contributions were allocated. The income or loss allocable to Excess Aggregate Contributions allocated to each
Participant is the income or loss allocable to the Participant’s Nondeductible Employee Contribution account, Matching Contribution
account, Qualified Matching Contribution account (if any, and if all amounts therein are not used in the ADP test) and, if applicable,
Qualified Nonelective Contribution account and Elective Deferral account(s) for the Plan Year multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is such Participant’s Excess Aggregate Contributions for the year and the denominator of which is the Participant’s Individual
Account balance(s) attributable to Contribution PePrcentage Amounts without regard to any income or loss occurring during such Plan
Year. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Plan Administrator may compute the income or loss allocable to Excess Aggregate
Contributions in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B) (i.e., the usual manner used by the Plan for allocating income or loss to
Participants’ Individual Accounts or any reasonable method), provided such method is used consistently for all Participants and for all
corrective distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year. The Plan will not fail to use a reasonable method for computing the income or
loss on Excess Aggregate Contributions merely because the income allocable is based on a date that is no more than seven days before
the distribution.
M
C. Accounting for Excess Aggregate Contributions – Excess Aggregate Contributions allocated to a Participant will be forfeited, if
forfeitable, or distributed on a pro rata basis from the Participant’s Nondeductible Employee Contribution account, Matching
Contribution account, and Qualified Matching Contribution account (and, if applicable, the Participant’s Qualified Nonelective
Contribution account or Elective Deferral account, or both). The Plan Administrator, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, will
determine whether the distribution of Elective Deferrals that are Excess Aggregate Contributions for a year will be made first from the
Participant’s Pre-Tax Elective Deferral account or the Roth Elective Deferral account, or a combination of both, to the extent both Pre-
Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals were made for the year, or may allow Participants to specify otherwise.
5.15 RECHARACTERIZATION
ProAvided the Plan allows Participants to make Nondeductible Employee Contributions, the Plan Administrator may, in a uniform and
nondiscriminatory manner, permit a Participant to elect to treat all or a portion of an Excess Contribution allocated to them as an amount
distributed to the Participant and then contributed by the Participant to the Plan as a Nondeductible Employee Contribution. Recharacterized
amounts will remain nonforfeitable and subject to the same distribution requirements as Elective Deferrals. Amounts may not be
recharacterized by a Highly Compensated Employee to the extent that such amount in combination with other Nondeductible Employee
Contributions made by that Employee would exceed any stated limit under the Plan on Nondeductible Employee Contributions.
Recharacterization must occur no later than 2½ months (six months in the case of Excess Contributions under an EACA if all Employees who
Sare eligible to participate are affected, as described in the Plan) after the last day of the Plan Year in which such Excess Contributions arose and
is deemed to occur no earlier than the date the last Highly Compensated Employee is informed (either in writing or in any other form
permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) of the amount recharacterized and the consequences. Recharacterized amounts will
be taxable to the Participant for the Participant’s tax year in which the Participant would have received them in cash.
5.16 LOANS TO PARTICIPANTS
If the Adoption Agreement so indicates, a Participant may receive a loan from the Fund, subject to the following rules and the Plan’s loan
policy.
A. Loans will be made available to all Participants on a reasonably equivalent basis. Notwithstanding the preceding, new loans will not
be available to Participants who cease to be employed by the Employer, unless such Participants are parties-in-interest as defined in
ERISA section 3(14). In addition, existing loans will be considered due and payable at such time as a Participant ceases to be an
Employee, and the loan will be considered in default and the Participant’s Individual Account will be reduced by the outstanding
amount of the loan unless otherwise specified in the loan policy statement or other loan documentation.
B. Loans will not be made available to Highly Compensated Employees in an amount greater than the amount made available to other
Employees.
C. Loans must be adequately secured and bear a reasonable interest rate.
D. No Participant loan will exceed the Present Value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 62 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 68]
E. A Participant must obtain the consent of their Spouse, if any, to the use of the Individual Account as security for the loan. Spousal
consent will be obtained no earlier than the beginning of the 90-day period that ends on the date on which the loan is to be so
secured. The consent must be in writing (or any other form permitted by the IRS and DOL), must acknowledge the effect of the loan,
and must be witnessed by a notary public or plan representative. Such consent will thereafter be binding with respect to the
consenting Spouse or any subsequent Spouse with respect to that loan. A new consent will be required if the Individual Account is
used for renegotiation, extension, renewal, or other revision of the loan. Notwithstanding the preceding, no spousal consent is
E
necessary if, at the time the loan is secured, no consent would be required for a distribution under Code section 417(a)(2)(B). In
addition, spousal consent is not required if the Plan or the Participant is not subject to Code section 401(a)(11) at the time the
Individual Account is used as security, or if the total Individual Account subject to the security is less than or equal to $5,000.
F. In the event of default, foreclosure on the note and attachment of security will not occur until a distribution eligibility requirement is
met under the Plan.
G. Loan repayments will be suspended under the Plan as permitted under Code section 414(u)(4) (USERRA).
L
H. For years beginning after 2005, if the Participant’s Individual Account contains any combination of Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth
Elective Deferrals, the specific rules governing the loan program may also designate the extent to which Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and
Roth Elective Deferrals, or any combination thereof will 1) be used to calculate the maximum amount available for a loan, or 2) be
available as a source from which loan proceeds may be taken or which may be used as security for a loan. To the extent permitted by law
and related regulations, the rules established by the Employer may specify the ordering rules to be applied in the event of a defaulted
loan. P
If a valid spousal consent has been obtained in accordance with Plan Section 5.16(E), then, notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Plan, the portion of the Participant’s Vested Individual Account used as a security interest held by the Plan by reason of a loan outstanding
to the Participant will be taken into account for purposes of determining the amount of the Individual Account payable at the time of
death or distribution, but only if the reduction is used as repayment of the loan. If less than 100 percent of the Participant’s Vested
Individual Account (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) is payable to the surviving Spouse, then the Individual Account
will be adjusted by first reducing the Vested Individual Account by the amount of the security used as repayment of the loan, and then
determining the benefit paMyable to the surviving Spouse.
To avoid taxation to the Participant, unless otherwise permitted by law or regulatory guidance, no loan to any Participant or Beneficiary
can be made to the extent that such loan, when added to the outstanding balance of all other loans to the Participant, would exceed the
lesser of 1) $50,000 reduced by the excess (if any) of the highest outstanding balance of loans during the one year period ending on the
day before the loan is made, over the outstanding balance of loans from the Plan on the date the loan is made, or 2) 50 percent of the
Present Value of the nonforfeitable Individual Account of the Participant. For the purpose of the above limitation, all loans from all plans of
the Employer and other members of a group of employers described in Code sections 414(b), 414(c), and 414(m) are aggregated.
Furthermore, any loan will by its terms require that repayment (principal and interest) be amortized in level payments, not less frequently
than quarterly, over a period not extending beyond five years from the date of the loan, unless such loan is used to acquire a dwelling unit
whiAch, within a reasonable time (determined at the time the loan is made), will be used as the principal residence of the Participant.
Notwithstanding the preceding, a Participant will suspend their loan repayments under this Plan as permitted under Code section
414(u)(4). An assignment or pledge of any portion of the Participant’s interest in the Plan and a loan, pledge, or assignment with respect to
any insurance contract purchased under the Plan, will be treated as a loan under this paragraph.
The Plan Administrator shall administer the loan program in accordance with specific rules that are documented either in writing or in such
other format as permitted by the IRS and the DOL. Such rules will include, at a minimum, the following: 1) the identity of the person or
positions authorized to administer the Participant loan program, 2) the procedure for applying for loans, 3) the basis on which loans will be
Sapproved or denied, 4) limitations (if any) on the types and amounts of loans offered, 5) the procedure under the program for determining
a reasonable rate of interest, 6) the types of collateral that may secure a Participant loan, and 7) the events constituting default and the
steps that will be taken to preserve Plan assets in the event of such default.
5.17 DISTRIBUTIONS OF IN-PLAN ROTH ROLLOVERS
Direct In-Plan Roth Rollover contributions and earnings thereon will be distributable at such time the Participant satisfies the distribution
eligibility requirements of the contribution source to which the rollover is attributable. At no time will Direct In-Plan Roth Rollover
contributions and earnings thereon be distributed before the asset source to which the rollover is attributable can be distributed under the
Code and/or Treasury Regulations.
Indirect In-Plan Roth Rollover contributions and earnings thereon will be distributable upon the Participant satisfying the distribution
eligibility requirements specified in the Plan for rollover contributions.
SECTION SIX: DEFINITIONS
Unless modified in Adoption Agreement Section Six, words and phrases used in the Plan with initial capital letters will, for the purpose of this Plan, have
the meanings set forth in the portion of the Plan entitled “Definitions” unless the context indicates that other meanings are intended.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 63 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 69]
SECTION SEVEN: MISCELLANEOUS
7.01 THE FUND
A. Establishment and Maintenance – By adopting this Plan, the Employer establishes the Fund, which will consist of the assets of the
Plan held by the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). Assets within the Fund may be pooled on behalf of all Participants, earmarked
E
on behalf of each Participant, or be a combination of pooled and earmarked assets. To the extent that assets are earmarked for a
particular Participant, they will be held in a Separate Fund for that Participant.
No part of the corpus or income of the Fund may be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of
Participants or their Beneficiaries. The Fund will be valued each Valuation Date at fair market value.
B. Division of Fund Into Investment Funds – The Employer may direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) to divide and redivide
the Fund into one or more Investment Funds. Such Investment Funds may include, but are not limited to, Investment Funds
representing the assets under the control of an investment manager puLrsuant to Plan Section 7.22(C) and Investment Funds
representing investment options available for individual direction by Participants pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(B). Upon each division
or redivision, the Employer may specify the part of the Fund to be allocated to each such Investment Fund and the terms and
conditions, if any, under which the assets in such Investment Fund will be invested.
7.02 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS
P
A. Establishment and Maintenance – The Plan Administrator shall establish and maintain an Individual Account in the name of each
Participant to reflect the total value of their interest in the Fund (including but not limited to Employer Contributions and earnings
thereon). Each Individual Account established hereunder will consist of such subaccounts as may be needed for each Participant,
including:
1. a subaccount to reflect Employer Contributions and Forfeitures allocated on behalf of a Participant;
2. a subaccount to reflect a Participant’s rollover contributions;
M
3. a subaccount to reflect a Participant’s transfer contributions;
4. a subaccount to reflect a Participant’s Nondeductible Employee Contributions;
5. a subaccount to reflect a Participant’s Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals;
6. a subaccount to reflect a Participant’s Roth Elective Deferrals; and
7. a subaccount to reflect a Participant’s Deemed IRA contributions.
The Plan Administrator may establish additional accounts as it may deem necessary for the proper administration of the Plan,
A
including, but not limited to, an account for Forfeitures as required pursuant to Plan Section 4.01(C) or (D).
If this Plan is funded by individual contracts that provide a Participant’s Benefit under the Plan, such individual contracts will
constitute the Participant’s Individual Account. If this Plan is funded by group contracts under the group annuity or group insurance
contract, premiums or other consideration received by the insurance company must be allocated to Participants’ Individual Accounts
under the Plan.
B. Valuation of Individual Accounts
S
1. Where all or a portion of the assets of a Participant’s Individual Account are invested in a Separate Fund for the Participant, then
the value of that portion of such Participant’s Individual Account at any relevant time equals the sum of the fair market values of
the assets in such Separate Fund, less any applicable charges or penalties.
2. The fair market value of the remainder of each Individual Account is determined in the following manner:
a. Separate Fund – First, the portion of the Individual Account invested in each Investment Fund as of the previous Valuation Date
is determined. Each such portion is reduced by any withdrawal made from the applicable Investment Fund to or for the benefit
of a Participant or the Participant’s Beneficiary, further reduced by any amounts forfeited by the Participant pursuant to Plan
Section 4.01(C) or (D), and further reduced by any transfer to another Investment Fund since the previous Valuation Date, and
is increased by any amount transferred from another Investment Fund since the previous Valuation Date. The resulting
amounts are the net Individual Account portions invested in the Investment Funds.
b. No Separate Fund – Second, the net Individual Account portions invested in each Investment Fund are adjusted upwards or
downwards, pro rata (i.e., using the ratio of each net Individual Account portion to the sum of all net Individual Account
portions) so that the sum of all the net Individual Account portions invested in an Investment Fund will equal the then fair
market value of the Investment Fund. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, for the first Plan Year only, the net Individual
Account portions will be the sum of all contributions made to each Participant’s Individual Account during the first Plan Year.
c. Allocations – Third, any contributions to the Plan and Forfeitures are allocated in accordance with the appropriate allocation
provisions of Plan Section Three. For purposes of this Plan Section Seven, contributions made by the Employer for any Plan
Year but after that Plan Year will be considered to have been made on the last day of that Plan Year regardless of when
paid to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable).
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 64 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 70]
Amounts contributed between Valuation Dates will not be credited with investment gains or losses until the next following
Valuation Date.
d. Aggregation of Portions – Finally, the portions of the Individual Account invested in each Investment Fund (determined in
accordance with (a), (b), and (c) above) are added together.
C. Modification of Method for Valuing Individual Accounts – If necessary or appropriate, Ethe Plan Administrator may establish
different or additional procedures (which will be uniform and nondiscriminatory) for determining the fair market value of the
Individual Accounts including, but not limited to, valuation on a daily basis pursuant to the number of shares of each permissible
investment held on behalf of a Participant.
7.03 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE PLAN ADMINISTRATOR
A. The Plan Administrator will have the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan. The Plan
Administrator shall administer the Plan for the exclusive benefit of the PLarticipants and their Beneficiaries in accordance with the
specific terms of the Plan.
B. The Plan Administrator may, by appointment, allocate the duties of the Plan Administrator among several individuals or entities. Such
appointments will not be effective until the party designated accepts such appointment in writing.
C. The Plan Administrator shall be charged with the duties of the general administration of the Plan, including, but not limited to, the
following: P
1. to determine all questions of interpretation or policy in a manner consistent with the Plan’s documents. The Plan Administrator’s
construction or determination in good faith will be conclusive and binding on all persons except as otherwise provided herein or
by law. Any interpretation or construction will be done in a nondiscriminatory manner and will be consistent with the intent that
the Plan will continue to be deemed a qualified plan under the terms of Code section 401(a), as amended from time to time, and
will comply with the terms of ERISA, as amended from time to time;
2. to determine all questions relating to the eligibility of Employees to become or remain Participants hereunder;
M
3. to compute the amounts necessary or desirable to be contributed to the Plan;
4. to compute the amount and kind of benefits to which a Participant or Beneficiary will be entitled under the Plan and to direct
the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) with respect to all disbursements under the Plan, and, when requested by the Trustee (or

required by law; and
8. to periodically review the performance of each Fiduciary and all other relevant parties to ensure such individuals’ obligations
under the Plan are performed in a manner that is acceptable under the Plan and applicable law.
SD. The Plan Administrator will have all of the powers necessary or appropriate to accomplish their duties under the Plan, including, but
not limited to, the following:
1. to appoint and retain such persons as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Plan Administrator;
2. to appoint and retain counsel, specialists, or other persons as the Plan Administrator deems necessary or advisable in the

3. to resolve all questions of administration of the Plan;
4. to establish such uniform and nondiscriminatory rules that it deems necessary to carry out the terms of the Plan;
5. to make any adjustments in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner that it deems necessary to correct any arithmetical or
accounting errors that may have been made for any Plan Year;
6. to correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any inconsistency in such manner and to such extent as will be deemed
necessary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the Plan; and
7. if the Plan permits a form of distribution other than a lump sum, and a Participant elects such form of distribution, the Plan
Administrator may place that Participant’s Individual Account into a segregated Investment Fund for the purpose of maintaining
the necessary liquidity to provide benefit installments on a periodic basis.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 65 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 71]
7.04 EXPENSES AND COMPENSATION
All reasonable expenses of administration, including, but not limited to, those involved in retaining necessary professional assistance, may
be paid from the assets of the Fund. Alternatively, the Employer may, in its discretion, pay any or all such expenses. Pursuant to uniform
and nondiscriminatory rules that the Plan Administrator may establish from time to time, administrative expenses and expenses unique to
a particular Participant or group of Participants may be charged to the Individual Account of such Participant or may be assessed against
terminated Participants even if not assessed against active Participants (subject to rules promulgEated by the IRS and the DOL), or the Plan
Administrator may allow Participants to pay such fees outside of the Plan. The Employer shall furnish the Plan Administrator with such
clerical and other assistance as the Plan Administrator may need in the performance of their duties.
7.05 INFORMATION FROM EMPLOYER
To enable the Plan Administrator to perform their duties, the Employer shall supply complete, accurate, and timely information to the Plan
Administrator (or their designated agents) on all matters relating to the Compensation of all Participants; their regular employment;
retirement, death, Disability, Severance from Employment, or Termination of Employment; and such other pertinent facts as the Plan
L
Administrator (or their agents) may require. The Plan Administrator shall advise the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) of such of the
preceding facts as may be pertinent to the Trustee’s (or Custodian’s) duties under the Plan. The Plan Administrator (or their agents) is
entitled to rely on such information as is supplied by the Employer and will have no duty or responsibility to verify such information. Such
information, including authorizations and directions, may be exchanged among the Employer, the Plan Administrator, the Trustee (or
Custodian, if applicable), or their agents through electronic, telephonic, or other means (including, for example, through the internet)
pursuant to applicable servicing arrangements in effect for the Plan.
P
7.06 PLAN AMENDMENTS
A. Right of Pre-approved Document Provider to Amend the Plan or Terminate Sponsorship
1. The Pre-approved Document Provider has the power to amend the Plan without any further action or consent of the Employer
as the Pre-approved Document Provider deems either necessary for the purpose of adjusting the Plan to comply with all laws
and regulations governing pension or profit sharing plans or desirable to the extent consistent with such laws and regulations.
Specifically, it isM understood that the amendments may be made unilaterally by the Pre-approved Document Provider. However,
it will be understood that the Pre-approved Document Provider will be under no obligation to amend the Plan documents, and
the Employer expressly waives any rights or claims against the Pre-approved Document Provider for not exercising this power to
amend. For purposes of Pre-approved Document Provider amendments, the mass submitter will generally be recognized as the
agent of the Pre-approved Document Provider. If the Pre-approved Document Provider does not adopt IRS model amendments
adopted by the mass submitter, the Plan will no longer be identical to or a minor modifier of the mass submitter plan and will be
considered an individually designed plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, the adoption of good faith IRS amendments must be
accomplished pursuant to the rules for each such amendment as prescribed by the IRS.
However, for purposes of reliance on an opinion letter, the Pre-approved Document Provider will no longer have the authority to
Aamend the Plan on behalf of the Employer as of the date the Employer amends the Plan to incorporate a type of plan that is not
permitted under the Revenue Procedure 2017-41 Pre-approved program, or as of the date the IRS notifies the Employer that the
Plan is an individually designed plan due to the nature and extent of the Employer’s amendments to the Plan.
2. An amendment by the Pre-approved Document Provider will be accomplished by giving notice (either in writing or in any other
form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Adopting Employer of the amendment to be made. The notice
will set forth the text of such amendment and the date such amendment is to be effective. Such amendment will take effect unless
within the 30-day period after such notice is provided, or within such shorter period as the notice may specify, the Adopting
SEmployer gives the Pre-approved Document Provider written notice of refusal to consent to the amendment. Such written notice of
refusal will have the effect of withdrawing the Plan as a pre-approved plan and will cause the Plan to be considered an individually
designed plan.
3. In addition to the amendment rights described above, the Pre-approved Document Provider will have the right to terminate its
sponsorship of this Plan by providing notice (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS
and DOL) to the Adopting Employer of such termination. Such termination of sponsorship will have the effect of withdrawing the
Plan as a pre-approved plan and will cause the Plan to be considered an individually designed plan. The Pre-approved
Document Provider will have the right to terminate its sponsorship of this Plan regardless of whether the Pre-approved
Document Provider has terminated sponsorship with respect to other employers adopting its pre-approved Plan.
B. Right of Adopting Employer to Amend the Plan – The Adopting Employer may amend the Plan to
1. change options previously selected in the Adoption Agreement;
2. add overriding language in the Adoption Agreement when such language is necessary to satisfy Code section 415 or Code
section 416 because of the required aggregation of multiple plans;
3. amend administrative provisions of the Plan such as provisions relating to investments, claims procedures, and Employer contact
information provided the amended provisions are not in conflict with any other provision of the Plan and do not cause the Plan
to fail to qualify under section 401;
4. add certain sample and model amendments published by the IRS or other required good faith amendments, that specifically
provide that their adoption will not cause the Plan to be treated as individually designed;
5. add or change provisions permitted under the Plan or specify or change the Effective Date of a provision as permitted under the Plan;
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 66 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 72]
6. amend to adjust for limitations provided under sections 415, 402(g), 401(a)(17) and 414(q)(1)(B) to reflect annual cost-of-living
increases, other than to add automatic cost-of-living adjustments to the Plan; and
7. make amendments that are related to a change in qualification requirements.
An Adopting Employer who wishes to amend the Plan shall document the amendment in writing, executed by a duly authorized
officer of the Adopting Employer. If the amendment is in the form of a restated Adoption AEgreement, the amendment will become
effective on the date provided in the Adoption Agreement. Any other amendment will become effective as described therein upon
execution by the Adopting Employer and, if appropriate, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). A copy of a restated Adoption
Agreement or other amendment must be provided to the Pre-approved Document Provider and the Trustee (or Custodian, if
applicable) before the effective date of the amendment.
The Adopting Employer further reserves the right to replace the Plan in its entirety by adopting another retirement plan which the
Adopting Employer designates as a replacement plan.
L
C. Limitation on Power to Amend – No amendment to the Plan will be effective to the extent that it has the effect of decreasing a
Participant’s accrued benefit. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Participant’s Individual Account may be reduced to the extent
permitted under Code section 412(d)(2) or to the extent permitted under Treasury Regulations sections 1.411(d)-3 and 1.411(d)-4. For
purposes of this paragraph, a Plan amendment that has the effect of decreasing a Participant’s Individual Account with respect to benefits
attributable to service before the amendment will be treated as reducing an accrued benefit. For purposes of this paragraph, a Participant
will not accrue a right to an allocation of an Employer Profit Sharing Contribution or Employer Money Purchase Pension Contribution for
P
the current Plan Year until the last day of such Plan Year and after the application of all amendments required or permitted by the IRS.
No amendment to the Plan will be effective to eliminate or restrict an optional form of benefit. The preceding sentence will not apply to a
Plan amendment that eliminates or restricts the ability of a Participant to receive payment of their Individual Account under a particular
optional form of benefit if the amendment provides a single-sum distribution form. Where this Plan document is being adopted to amend
another plan that contains a protected benefit not provided for in this document, the Employer must complete a “Protected Benefit and
Prior Plan Document Provisions Attachment,” describing such protected benefit which, will become part of the Plan.
D. Amendment of VestMing Schedule – For purposes of this provision, if the vesting schedule of the Plan is amended, an Employee who
is a Participant as of the later of the date such amendment is adopted or the date it becomes effective, the Vested percentage
(determined as of such date) of such Employee’s Individual Account derived from Employer Contributions will not be less than the
percentage computed under the Plan as of that date without regard to such amendment. Furthermore, if the Plan’s vesting schedule
is amended, or the Plan is amended in any way that directly or indirectly affects the computation of the Participant’s Vested
percentage, or if the Plan is deemed amended by an automatic change to or from a top-heavy vesting schedule, each Participant with
at least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable) with the Employer may elect, within the time set forth below,
to have the Vested percentage computed under the Plan without regard to such amendment.
The period during which the election may be made will commence with the date the amendment is adopted or deemed to be made
Aand will end the later of:
1. 60 days after the amendment is adopted;
2. 60 days after the amendment becomes effective; or
3. 60 days after the Participant is issued a notice (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the
IRS and DOL) of the amendment by the Employer or Plan Administrator.
SWith respect to benefits accrued as of the later of the adoption or effective date of the amendment, the Vested percentage of each
Participant will be the greater of the Vested percentage under the old vesting schedule or the Vested percentage under the new
vesting schedule.
7.07 PLAN MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION
In the case of any merger or consolidation of the Plan with, or transfer of assets or liabilities of such Plan to, any other plan, each
Participant will be entitled to receive benefits immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer (if the Plan had then terminated) that
are equal to or greater than the benefits they would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation, or
transfer (if the Plan had then terminated). The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) has the authority to enter into merger agreements or
agreements to directly transfer the assets of this Plan, but only if such agreements are made with trustees or custodians of other
retirement plans described in Code section 401(a) or such other plans permitted by laws or regulations. If it is later determined that all or
part of a non-elective transfer was ineligible to be transferred into the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall direct that any ineligible amounts,
plus earnings or losses attributable thereto (determined in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B)), be returned to the transferor
plan or correct the ineligible transfer using any other method permitted by the IRS under regulation or other guidance.
7.08 PERMANENCY
The Employer expects to continue this Plan and make the necessary contributions thereto indefinitely, but such continuance and payment
is not assumed as a contractual obligation. Neither the Adoption Agreement nor the Plan nor any amendment or modification thereof nor
the making of contributions hereunder will be construed as giving any Participant or any other person any legal or equitable right against
the Employer, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), the Plan Administrator, or the Pre-approved Document Provider except as
specifically provided herein, or as provided by law.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 67 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 73]
7.09 METHOD AND PROCEDURE FOR TERMINATION
The Plan may be terminated by the Adopting Employer at any time by appropriate action of its managing body. Such termination will be
effective on the date specified by the Adopting Employer. The Plan shall terminate, if required by either the IRS or the DOL, if the Adopting
Employer is dissolved or terminated. Written notice of the termination and effective date thereof will be given to the Trustee (or Custodian,
if applicable), Plan Administrator, Pre-approved Document Provider, and the Participants and Beneficiaries of deceased Participants. The
required filings (such as the Form 5500 series and others) must be made by the Adopting EmploEyer with the IRS and any other regulatory
body as required by current laws and regulations. Until all of the assets have been distributed from the Fund, the Adopting Employer must
keep the Plan in compliance with current laws and regulations by making appropriate amendments to the Plan and by taking such other
measures as may be required. If the Plan is abandoned by the Adopting Employer, however, a qualified termination administrator (QTA) (or
other entity permitted by the IRS or DOL) may terminate the Plan according to rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, a reversion to the Employer of amounts contributed to the Plan that exceed the
limitations imposed under Code section 415(c) may occur upon termination of the Plan according to rules promulgated by the IRS.
L
7.10 CONTINUANCE OF PLAN BY SUCCESSOR EMPLOYER
Notwithstanding the preceding Plan Section 7.09, a successor of the Adopting Employer may continue the Plan and be substituted in the
place of the present Adopting Employer. The successor and the present Adopting Employer (or, if deceased, the executor of the estate of a
deceased Self-Employed Individual who was the Adopting Employer) must execute a written instrument authorizing such substitution, and
the successor shall amend the Plan in accordance with Plan Section 7.06.
P
7.11 CORRECTION
The Employer may correct operational errors or issues involving the Plan in accordance with correction programs established by or
guidance issued from the IRS or such other correction methods allowed by statute, regulation or regulatory authority. For example, the
Employer must correct any Excess Annual Additions allocated to a Participant, the inclusion of ineligible employees or the exclusion of
eligible Participants using any method permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS) or allowed by the IRS
or DOL under regulations or other guidance. EPCRS is currently described in Revenue Procedure 2016-51. To the extent that a correction
requires a repayment to the Plan of improperly distributed benefits, the Employer or Plan Administrator may take action to recover such
amounts from the respectMive Participants or Beneficiaries.
If the Plan fails to retain its qualified status, the Plan will no longer be considered to be part of a pre-approved plan, and such Employer
can no longer participate under this pre-approved. In such event, the Plan will be considered an individually designed plan.
7.12 GOVERNING LAWS AND PROVISIONS
To the extent such laws are not preempted by federal law, the terms and conditions of this Plan will be governed by the laws of the state in
which the Pre-approved Document Provider is located, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Pre-approved Document Provider and
the Employer.
In tAhe event of any conflict between the provisions of this Basic Plan Document and provisions of the Adoption Agreement, the summary
plan description, or any related documents, the Basic Plan Document will control.
7.13 STATE COMMUNITY PROPERTY LAWS
The terms and conditions of this Plan will be applicable without regard to the community property laws of any state.
7.14 HEADINGS
The headings of the Plan have been inserted for convenience of reference only and are to be ignored in any construction of the provisions
S
hereof.
7.15 GENDER AND NUMBER
Whenever any words are used herein in the masculine gender, they will be construed as though they were also used in the feminine
gender in all cases where they would so apply, and whenever any words are used herein in the singular form, they will be construed as
though they were also used in the plural form in all cases where they would so apply.
7.16 STANDARD OF FIDUCIARY CONDUCT
The Employer, Plan Administrator, Trustee, and any other Fiduciary under this Plan shall discharge their duties with respect to this Plan
solely in the interests of Participants and their Beneficiaries, and with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then
prevailing that a prudent person acting in like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like
character and with like aims. No Fiduciary will cause the Plan to engage in any transaction known as a “non-exempt prohibited transaction”
under either the Code or ERISA.
7.17 GENERAL UNDERTAKING OF ALL PARTIES
All parties to this Plan and all persons claiming any interest whatsoever hereunder agree to perform any and all acts and execute any and
all documents and papers that may be necessary or desirable for the carrying out of this Plan and any of its provisions.

7.19 DETERMINATION OF TOP-HEAVY STATUS
A. In General – Except as provided in Plan Section 7.19(B), this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan if any of the following conditions exist:
1. if the top-heavy ratio for this Plan exceeds 60 percent and this Plan is not part of any Required Aggregation Group or Permissive
Aggregation Group of plans;
E
2. if this Plan is part of a Required Aggregation Group of plans but not part of a Permissive Aggregation Group and the top-heavy
ratio for the group of plans exceeds 60 percent; or
3. if this Plan is a part of a Required Aggregation Group and part of a Permissive Aggregation Group of plans and the top-heavy
ratio for the Permissive Aggregation Group exceeds 60 percent.
B. Top-Heavy Ratio
1. If the Employer maintains one or more defined contribution plans L(including any simplified employee pension plan) and the
Employer has not maintained any defined benefit plan that during the five-year period ending on the Determination Date(s) has
or has had accrued benefits, the top-heavy ratio for this Plan alone or for the Required or Permissive Aggregation Group as
appropriate is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the account balances of all Key Employees as of the
Determination Date(s) (including any part of any account balance distributed in the one-year period ending on the
Determination Date(s) (five-year period ending on the Determination Date in the case of a distribution made for a reason other
than Severance from Employment, death, or Disability and in determining whether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan Years
P
beginning before January 1, 2002)) and the denominator of which is the sum of all account balances (including any part of any
account balance distributed in the one-year period ending on the Determination Date(s), (five-year period ending on the
Determination Date in the case of a distribution made for a reason other than Severance from Employment, death, or Disability
and in determining whether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2002)) both computed in
accordance with Code section 416 and the corresponding regulations. Both the numerator and the denominator of the top-
heavy ratio are increased to reflect any contribution not actually made as of the Determination Date, but that is required to be
taken into account on that date under Code section 416 and the corresponding regulations.
M
2. If the Employer maintains one or more defined contribution plans (including any simplified employee pension plan) and the
Employer maintains or has maintained one or more defined benefit plans that during the five-year period ending on the
Determination Date(s) has or has had any accrued benefits, the top-heavy ratio for any Required or Permissive Aggregation
Group, as appropriate, is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of account balances under the aggregated defined
contribution plan or plans for all Key Employees, determined in accordance with 1) above, and the Present Value of accrued
benefits under the aggregated defined benefit plan or plans for all Key Employees as of the Determination Date(s), and the
denominator of which is the sum of the account balances under the aggregated defined contribution plan or plans for all
Participants, determined in accordance with 1) above, and the Present Value of accrued benefits under the defined benefit plan
or plans for all Participants as of the Determination Date(s), all determined in accordance with Code section 416 and the
A
corresponding regulations. The accrued benefits under a defined benefit plan in both the numerator and denominator of the
top-heavy ratio are increased for any distribution of an accrued benefit made in the one-year period ending on the
Determination Date (five-year period ending on the Determination Date in the case of a distribution made for a reason other
than Severance from Employment, death, or Disability and in determining whether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan Years
beginning before January 1, 2002).
3. For purposes of (1) and (2) above, the value of account balances and the Present Value of accrued benefits will be determined as of
the most recent Valuation Date that falls within or ends with the 12-month period ending on the Determination Date, except as
S
provided in Code section 416 and the corresponding regulations for the first and second plan years of a defined benefit plan. The
account balances and accrued benefits of a Participant 1) who is not a Key Employee but who was a Key Employee in a prior year, or
2) who has not been credited with at least one Hour of Service with any employer maintaining the plan at any time during the one-
year period (five-year period ending on the Determination Date in the case of a distribution made for a reason other than Severance
from Employment, death, or Disability and in determining whether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan Years beginning before January 1,
2002) ending on the Determination Date will be disregarded. The calculation of the top-heavy ratio, and the extent to which
distributions, rollovers, and transfers are taken into account will be made in accordance with Code section 416 and the
corresponding regulations. Deductible employee contributions will not be taken into account for purposes of computing the top-
heavy ratio. When aggregating plans, the value of account balances and accrued benefits will be calculated with reference to the
Determination Dates that fall within the same calendar year.
The accrued benefit of a Participant other than a Key Employee will be determined under 1) the method, if any, that uniformly applies
for accrual purposes under all defined benefit plans maintained by the Employer, or 2) if there is no such method, as if such benefit
accrued not more rapidly than the slowest accrual rate permitted under the fractional rule of Code section 411(b)(1)(C).
C. SIMPLE 401(k) Plan Exception – Notwithstanding Plan Section 7.19(A) above, the Plan is not treated as a Top-Heavy Plan under
Code section 416 for any Year for which an Eligible Employer maintains this Plan as a SIMPLE 401(k) Plan.
D. Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan Exception – Notwithstanding Plan Section 7.19(A) above, the Plan is not treated as a Top-Heavy Plan under
Code section 416 for any Year for which an Eligible Employer makes only those contributions described in Code sections 401(k)(12)
and 401(m)(11) for any Plan Year. If any other contributions are made for a Plan Year (e.g., Employer Profit Sharing Contributions,
forfeitures), the top-heavy rules described in Code section 416(g)(4)(H) will apply for that Plan Year. However, ADP Test Safe Harbor
Contributions and ACP Test Safe Harbor Matching Contributions may be applied to satisfy all or a portion of the top-heavy
contribution, if any, that may be required.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 69 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 75]
E. QACA Plan Exception – Notwithstanding Plan Section 7.19(A) above, the Plan is not treated as a Top-Heavy Plan under Code section
416 for any Year for which an Employer makes only those contributions described in Code sections 401(k)(13) and 401(m)(12). If any
other contributions are made for a Plan Year (e.g., Employer Profit Sharing Contributions, forfeitures), the top-heavy rules described in
Code section 416(g)(4)(H) will apply for that Plan Year.
7.20 INALIENABILITY OF BENEFITS
E
No benefit or interest available under the Plan will be subject to assignment or alienation, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The preceding
sentence will not apply to judgments and settlements described in Code section 401(a)(13)(C) and ERISA section 206(d)(4). Such sentence
will, however, apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a Participant pursuant to a
Domestic Relations Order, unless such order is determined to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order as defined in the Definitions section
of the Plan.
Generally, a Domestic Relations Order cannot be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order until January 1, 1985. However, in the case of a
Domestic Relations Order entered before January 1, 1985, the Plan AdministrLator:
1. shall treat such order as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order if the Plan Administrator is paying benefits pursuant to such order on
January 1, 1985; and
2. may treat any other such order entered before January 1, 1985, as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order even if such order does not
meet the requirements of Code section 414(p).
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contPrary, a distribution to an Alternate Payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order
will be permitted even if the Participant affected by such order is not otherwise entitled to a distribution, and even if such Participant has
not attained the earliest retirement age as defined in Code section 414(p).
7.21 BONDING
Every Fiduciary and every person who handles funds or other property of the Plan shall be bonded to the extent required by ERISA section
412 and the corresponding regulations for purposes of protecting the Plan against loss by reason of acts of fraud or dishonesty on the
part of the person, group,M or class, alone or in connivance with others, to be covered by such bond. The amount of the bond will be fixed
at the beginning of each Plan Year and will not be less than ten-percent of the amount of funds handled. The amount of funds handled will
be determined by the funds handled the previous Plan Year or, if none, the amount of funds estimated, in accordance with rules provided
by the Secretary of Labor, to be handled during the current Plan Year. Notwithstanding the preceding, no bond will be less than $1,000 nor
more than $500,000, except that the Secretary of Labor will have the right to prescribe an amount in excess of $500,000. In the case of a
Plan that holds employer securities (within the meaning of ERISA section 407(d)(1)), the maximum bond amount is $1,000,000 or such
other amount as the Secretary of Labor prescribes.
7.22 INVESTMENT AUTHORITY
A. APlan Investments – Except as provided in Plan Section 7.22(B) (relating to individual direction of investments by Participants), the
Adopting Employer, not the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), will have exclusive management and control over the investment of
the Fund into any permitted investment. The Adopting Employer will be responsible for establishing a funding policy statement on
behalf of the Plan and shall provide a copy of such funding policy statement to the Trustee who has the authority or discretion to
select the appropriate investments for the Fund, if any. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Trustee has the authority or discretion
to select the appropriate investments for the Fund, such Trustee may enter into an agreement with the Adopting Employer whereby
the Trustee will manage the investment of all or a portion of the Fund. Any such agreement will be in writing and will set forth such
matters as such Trustee deems necessary or desirable.
S
B. Direction of Investments by Participants – Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, each Participant will have the
responsibility for directing the Trustee (or Custodian, if provided for under a separate agreement between the Adopting Employer and the
Custodian), regarding the investment of all or part of their Individual Account. If all of the requirements pertaining to Participant direction
of investment in ERISA section 404(c)(1) are satisfied, then to the extent so directed, the Adopting Employer, Plan Administrator, Trustee,
Custodian (if applicable), and all other Fiduciaries are relieved of Fiduciary liability under ERISA section 404.
The Plan Administrator shall direct that a Separate Fund be established in the name of each Participant who directs the investment of part
or all of their Individual Account. Each Separate Fund will be charged or credited (as appropriate) with the earnings, gains, losses, or
expenses attributable to such Separate Fund. No Fiduciary will be liable for any loss that results from a Participant’s individual direction. The
assets subject to individual direction will not be invested in collectibles as that term is defined in Code section 408(m).
The Plan Administrator shall establish such uniform and nondiscriminatory rules relating to individual direction as it deems necessary or
advisable including, but not limited to, rules describing 1) which portions of Participants’ Individual Accounts can be individually directed,
2) the frequency of investment changes, 3) the forms and procedures for making investment changes, and 4) the effect of a Participant’s
failure to make a valid direction.
The Plan Administrator may, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, limit the available investments for Participants’ individual
direction to certain specified investment options (including, but not limited to, certain mutual funds, investment contracts, deposit
accounts, and group trusts). The Plan Administrator may permit, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, a Beneficiary of a
deceased Participant or the Alternate Payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order to individually direct investments in
accordance with this Plan Section 7.22(B).
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 70 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 76]
Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, if the Adoption Agreement permits Participants to direct investments and also
names a Trustee that does not have the authority or discretion to select the appropriate investments for the Fund, such Participants
will furnish investment instruction to the Plan Administrator under procedures adopted by the Adopting Employer and/or the Plan
Administrator consistent with the Plan, and it will be the responsibility of the Plan Administrator to provide direction to such Trustee
regarding the investment of such amounts. If a Participant who has the right to direct investments under the terms of the Plan fails to
provide such direction to the Plan Administrator, the Plan Administrator shall direct the investment of such Participant’s Individual
E
Accounts. The Plan Administrator shall maintain records showing the interest of each Participant and/or Beneficiary in the Fund unless
the Trustee enters into a written agreement with the Adopting Employer to keep separate accounts for each such Participant or
Beneficiary.
C. Investment Managers
1. Definition of Investment Manager – The Adopting Employer may appoint one or more investment managers to make investment
decisions with respect to all or a portion of the Fund. The investment manager will be any firm or individual registered as an
L
investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, a bank as defined in said Act, or an insurance company qualified
under the laws of more than one state to perform services consisting of the management, acquisition, or disposition of any
assets of the Plan.
2. Investment Manager’s Authority – A separate Investment Fund will be established representing the assets of the Fund invested
at the direction of the investment manager. The investment manager so appointed shall direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if
applicable) with respect to the investment oPf such Investment Fund. The investments that may be acquired at the direction of
the investment manager are those described in Plan Section 7.22(D).
3. Written Agreement – The appointment of any investment manager will be by written agreement between the Adopting Employer and
the investment manager, and a copy of such agreement (and any modification or termination thereof) must be given to the Trustee
(or Custodian, if applicable). The agreement will set forth, among other matters, the effective date of the investment manager’s
appointment and an acknowledgment by the investment manager that it is a Fiduciary of the Plan under ERISA.
4. Concerning the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) – Written notice of each appointment of an investment manager will be given to
M
the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) at least 30 days in advance of the effective date of such appointment. Such notice will specify
which portion of the Fund will constitute the Investment Fund subject to the investment manager’s direction. The Trustee (or
Custodian, if applicable) will comply with the investment direction given to it by the investment manager and will not be liable for any
loss which may result by reason of any action (or inaction) it takes at the direction of the investment manager.
D. Permissible Investments – The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) may invest the assets of the Plan in property of any character, real or
personal, including, but not limited to, the following: stocks, including Qualifying Employer Securities, and including shares of open-end
investment companies (mutual funds); bonds; notes; debentures; proprietary mutual funds; deposit accounts; options; limited partnership
interests; mortgages; real estate or any interests therein (including Qualifying Employer Real Property); unit investment trusts; Treasury
Bills, and other U.S. Government obligations; common trust funds, combined investment trusts, collective trust funds or commingled
A
funds maintained by a bank or similar financial organization (whether or not the Trustee hereunder); savings accounts, certificates of
deposit, demand or time deposits or money market accounts of a bank or similar financial organization (whether or not the Trustee
hereunder); unless excluded in the Adoption Agreement, annuity contracts that are “guaranteed benefit policies,” as defined in ERISA
section 401(b)(2)(B); life insurance policies; or in such other investments as is deemed proper without regard to investments authorized by
statute or rule of law governing the investment of trust funds but with regard to ERISA and this Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, the Pre-approved Document Provider may, as a condition of making the Plan available to the Adopting Employer, limit the
types of property in which the assets of the Plan may be invested. The list of permissible investment options will be further limited in
Saccordance with any applicable law, regulations, or other restrictions applicable to the Trustee or Custodian, including, but not limited to,
internal operational procedures adopted by such Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). The actions of a Trustee who has the authority or
discretion to select the appropriate investments for the Fund will also be subject to the funding policy statement provided by the
Adopting Employer. If any Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) invests all or any portion of the Fund pursuant to written instructions
provided by the Adopting Employer (including an investment manager appointed by the Adopting Employer pursuant to Plan Section
7.22(C)) or any Participant pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(B), the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be deemed to have invested
pursuant to the Adopting Employer’s funding policy statement.
To the extent the assets of the Plan are invested in a group trust, including a collective trust fund or commingled funds maintained by
a bank or similar financial organization, the declaration of trust of such composite trust will be deemed to be a part of the Plan, and
any investment in such composite trust will be subject to all of the provisions of such declaration of trust, as the same may be
amended or supplemented from time to time.
If the responsibility for directing investments for Elective Deferrals (and earnings) is executed by someone other than the Participants,
the acquisition of Qualifying Employer Securities and Qualifying Employer Real Property will be limited to ten-percent of the fair
market value of the assets of the Plan, to the extent required by ERISA section 407(b)(2).
E. Matters Relating to Insurance
1. If elected by the Adopting Employer in the Adoption Agreement, a life insurance contract may be purchased on behalf of a
Participant. No life insurance contract may be purchased unless the insured under the contract is the Participant or, where this
Plan is a profit sharing or 401(k) plan, the Participant’s Spouse or another individual in whom the Participant has an insurable
interest. If a life insurance contract is to be purchased for a Participant, the aggregate premium for certain life insurance for each
Participant must be less than a certain percentage of the aggregate Employer Contributions and Forfeitures allocated to a
Participant’s Individual Account at any particular time as follows.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 71 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 77]
a. Ordinary Life Insurance – For purposes of these incidental insurance provisions, ordinary life insurance contracts are
contracts with both nondecreasing death benefits and nonincreasing premiums. If such contracts are purchased, less than
50 percent of the aggregate Employer Contributions and Forfeitures allocated to any Participant’s Individual Account will
be used to pay the premiums attributable to them.
b. Term and Universal Life Insurance – No more than 25 percent of the aggregate Employer Contributions and Forfeitures
allocated to any Participant’s Individual Account will be used to pay the premiumEs on term life insurance contracts,
universal life insurance contracts, and all other life insurance contracts that are not ordinary life.
c. Combination – The sum of 50 percent of the ordinary life insurance premiums and all other life insurance premiums will not
exceed 25 percent of the aggregate Employer Contributions and Forfeitures allocated to any Participant’s Individual Account.
If this Plan is a profit sharing plan, the above incidental benefits limits do not apply to life insurance contracts (1) purchased by
an Employee who has been a Participant in the Plan for five or more years, (2) purchased with Employer Contributions and
Forfeitures that have been in the Participant’s Individual Account foLr at least two full Plan Years, measured from the date such
contributions were allocated, or (3) purchased using rollover contributions. For purposes of this Plan Section 7.22(E)(1), transfer
contributions will be considered Employer Contributions, and therefore may be used to pay contract premiums. No part of the
Deductible Employee Contribution account will be used to purchase life insurance.
2. Subject to Plan Section 5.10, the contracts on a Participant’s life will be converted to cash or an annuity or distributed to the
Participant upon separation from service with the Employer. In addition, contracts on the joint lives of a Participant and another
P
person may not be maintained under this Plan if such Participant ceases to have an insurable interest in such other person.
3. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) shall apply for and will be the owner of any insurance contract(s) purchased under the terms
of this Plan. The insurance contract(s) must provide that proceeds will be payable to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable).
However, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be required to pay over all proceeds of the contract(s) to the Participant’s
Designated Beneficiary in accordance with the distribution provisions of this Plan. A Participant’s Spouse will be the designated
beneficiary of the proceeds in all circumstances unless a Qualified Election has been made in accordance with Plan Section 5.10.
Under no circumstances will the Fund retain any part of the proceeds. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Plan and
M
the terms of any insurance contract purchased hereunder, the Plan provisions will control.
4. The Plan Administrator may direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) to sell and distribute insurance or annuity contracts to
a Participant (or other party as may be permitted) in accordance with applicable law or regulations.
5. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, and except as may be otherwise provided by ERISA, the Employer will indemnify
and hold harmless the insurer, its officers, directors, employees, agents, heirs, executors, successors, and assigns, from and
against any and all liabilities, damages, judgments, settlements, losses, costs, charges, or expenses (including legal expenses) at
any time arising out of or incurred in connection with any action taken by such parties in the performance of their duties with
respect to this Plan, unless there has been a final adjudication of gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of
Asuch duties.
Further, except as may be otherwise provided by ERISA, the Employer will indemnify the insurer from any liability, claim, or
expense (including legal expense) that the insurer incurs by reason of, or which results in whole or in part from, the reliance of
the insurer on the facts and other directions and elections the Employer communicates or fails to communicate.
F. Diversification Requirements When Employer Securities are Held as Investments in the Plan – For Plan Years beginning on or
after January 1, 2007, Code section 401(a)(35) requires qualified retirement plans that hold employer securities to allow Participants,
SAlternate Payees with Individual Accounts under the Plan, or Beneficiaries of deceased Participants to diversify their investments. This
Code section and other relevant guidance govern the diversification procedures, which include the following.
1. Employee Contributions and Elective Deferrals Invested in Employer Securities – In the case of the portion of an Individual Account
attributable to Nondeductible Employee Contributions and Elective Deferrals (if applicable) that are invested in employer securities,
the Participant, Alternate Payee, or Beneficiary, as applicable, may elect to direct the Plan to divest any such securities and to reinvest
an equivalent amount in other investments that meet the investment option requirements below.
2. Employer Contributions Invested in Employer Securities – In the case of the portion of an Individual Account attributable to
Employer Contributions other than Elective Deferrals that are invested in employer securities, a Participant who has completed at
least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable), an Alternative Payee with respect to a Participant who has
completed at least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable), or a Beneficiary, as applicable, may elect to direct
the Plan to divest any such securities and to reinvest an equivalent amount in other investments that meet the investment option
requirements below. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Plan provides for immediate vesting, the three years of service
requirement will be satisfied on the day immediately preceding the third anniversary of the Participant’s date of hire.
3. Investment Options – The diversification requirements above are met if the Plan offers not less than three investment options,
other than employer securities, to which a Participant, Alternate Payee, or Beneficiary, as applicable may direct the proceeds
from the divestment of employer securities, each of which is diversified and has materially different risk and return
characteristics. The Plan may limit the time for divestment and reinvestment to periodic, reasonable opportunities that occur no
less frequently than quarterly. Except as provided in regulations, the Plan must not impose employer securities investment
restrictions or conditions that are not imposed on the investment of other Plan assets (other than restrictions or conditions
imposed by securities laws or other relevant guidance) except that a Plan may allow for more frequent transfers to or from either
a stable value fund or a qualified default investment alternative.

[PAGE 78]
4. Exception for Certain Plans – The diversification requirement does not apply to a one-Participant retirement plan, an employee
stock ownership plan (ESOP) if 1) there are no contributions or earnings in the ESOP that are held within such plan and that are
subject to Code sections 401(k) or (m), and 2) such plan is a separate plan for purposes of Code section 414(l) with respect to
any other defined benefit plan or defined contribution plan maintained by the same employer or employers, or to a retirement
plan where employer securities are held in an investment fund as described in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(35)-
1(f)(2)(B)(3)(ii).
E
5. Transition Rule for Securities Attributable to Employer Contributions – In the case of the portion of an Individual Account
attributable to Employer Contributions other than Elective Deferrals that are invested in employer securities, including, a Participant
who has completed at least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable), an Alternate Payee with respect to a
Participant who has completed at least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable), or a Beneficiary, as
applicable, the employer securities acquired in a Plan Year beginning before January 1, 2007, will be subject to the following
divestiture and reinvestment transition schedule, which applies separately with respect to each class of securities.
L
For the Plan Year in which diversification requirement applies, the applicable percentage subject to diversification is:
 First. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33%
 Second. . . . . . . . . . . . . 66%
 Third. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .100%
This three-year phase-in requirement does not apply to a Participant who has attained age 55 and who has completed
P
at least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable) before the first Plan Year beginning after
December 31, 2005.
Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Plan provides for immediate vesting, the three-years-of-service requirement will be
satisfied on the day immediately preceding the third anniversary of the Participant’s date of hire.
G. Qualifying Longevity Annuity Contract (QLAC)
1. If elected by theM Adopting Employer in the Adoption Agreement, a Qualifying Longevity Annuity Contract (QLAC) may be purchased
on behalf of a Participant. Such Qualifying Longevity Annuity Contract is an annuity contract, purchased from an insurance company
on or after July 2, 2014, for the benefit of a Participant under the Plan, stating its intent to be a QLAC and otherwise meeting the
requirements under Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-6.
a. Excess Premiums – The amount of the premiums paid for the QLAC under the Plan will not exceed the lesser of:
(i) an amount equal to the excess of $125,000 (as adjusted by the Commissioner) over the sum of
(A) the premiums paid before that date with respect to the contract, and
A(B) premiums paid on or before that date with respect to any other contract that is intended to be a QLAC and that
is purchased for the Participant under the Plan, or any other plan, annuity, or account described in Code section
401(a), 403(a), 403(b), or 408 or eligible governmental plan under Code section 457(b); or
(ii) an amount equal to the excess of
(A) 25 percent of the Participant’s Individual Account balance (as of the last Valuation Date preceding the date of the
premium payment) under the Plan (including the value of any QLAC held under the Plan for the Participant) as of
the contract date, over
S
(B) the sum of premiums paid before that date with respect to the contract and premiums paid on or before that
date with respect to any other contract that is intended to be a QLAC and that is held or was purchased for the
Participant under the Plan.
If an annuity contract fails to be a QLAC solely because a premium for the contract exceeds the above limits, the excess
premium will be returned (either in cash or in the form of a contract that is not intended to be a QLAC) to the non-QLAC
portion of the Participant’s Individual Account by the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
excess premium was originally paid.
d. Distributions – Distributions under the QLAC portion of the Participant’s Individual Account will commence not later than
the first day of the month next following the participant’s 85th birthday. After distributions commence, those distributions
will satisfy all applicable required minimum distribution requirements from that point forward (other than the requirement
that annuity payments commence on or before the Required Beginning Date.).
7.23 PROCEDURES AND OTHER MATTERS REGARDING DOMESTIC RELATIONS ORDERS
A. To the extent provided in any Qualified Domestic Relations Order, the former Spouse of a Participant will be treated as a surviving
Spouse of such Participant for purposes of any benefit payable in the form of either a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or
Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity.
B. The Plan will not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of the Code, which generally prohibits payment of benefits before the
Participant’s Termination of Employment or Severance from Employment, as applicable, with the Employer, solely by reason of
payments to an Alternate Payee pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 73 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 79]
C. In the case of any Domestic Relations Order received by the Plan:
1. the Plan Administrator shall promptly notify the Participant and any other Alternate Payee of the receipt of such order and the
Plan’s procedure for determining the qualified status of Domestic Relations Orders; and
2. within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, the Plan Administrator shall determine whether such order is a Qualified
Domestic Relations Order and notify the Participant and each Alternate Payee of suchE determination.
The Plan Administrator shall establish reasonable procedures to determine the qualified status of Domestic Relations Orders and to
administer distributions under such qualified orders.
D. During any period in which the issue of whether a Domestic Relations Order is a Qualified Domestic Relations Order is being
determined by the Plan Administrator, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise, the Plan Administrator shall segregate in a
separate account in the Plan or in an escrow account the amounts which would have been payable to the Alternate Payee during such
period if the order had been determined to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order. If within 18 months the order or modification
L
thereof is determined to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, the Plan Administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (plus any
interest thereon) to the person or persons entitled thereto. If within 18 months either 1) it is determined that the order is not a
Qualified Domestic Relations Order, or 2) the issue as to whether such order is a Qualified Domestic Relations Order is not resolved,
then the Plan Administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (plus any interest thereon) to the person or persons who would have
been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order. Any determination that an order is a Qualified Domestic Relations Order
that is made after the close of the 18-month period will be applied prospectively only.
P
7.24 INDEMNIFICATION OF PRE-APPROVED DOCUMENT PROVIDER
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, and except as may be otherwise provided by ERISA, the Employer shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Pre-approved Document Provider, its officers, directors, employees, agents, heirs, executors, successors, and assigns, from
and against any and all liabilities, damages, judgments, settlements, losses, costs, charges, or expenses (including legal expenses) at any
time arising out of or incurred in connection with any action taken by such parties in the performance of their duties with respect to this
Plan, unless there has been a final adjudication of gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of such duties. Further, except
as may be otherwise proviMded by ERISA, the Employer will indemnify the Pre-approved Document Provider from any liability, claim, or
expense (including legal expense) that the Pre-approved Document Provider incurs by reason of, or which results in whole or in part from,
the reliance of the Pre-approved Document Provider on the facts and other directions and elections the Employer, Plan Administrator, or
Investment Fiduciary communicates or fails to communicate.
7.25 MILITARY SERVICE
Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits, and service credit with respect to qualified military
service will be provided in accordance with Code section 414(u), including, but not limited to the following.
A. Benefit Accrual in the Case of Death or Disability Resulting from Active Military Service.
A
1. Benefit Accrual – If elected in the Adoption Agreement, for benefit accrual purposes, an individual who dies or becomes disabled
while performing qualified military service (as defined in Code section 414(u)) will be treated as if the individual resumed employment
in accordance with the individual’s reemployment rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of
1994 (USERRA), on the day preceding death or Disability (as applicable) and terminated employment on the actual date of death or
Disability. If the Employer elects to treat an individual as having resumed employment as described above, subject to items (2) and (3)
below, any full or partial compliance by the Plan with respect to the benefit accrual requirements will be treated for purposes of Code
section 414(u)(1) as if such compliance were required under USERRA.
S
2. Nondiscrimination Requirement – Part A, item (1) above will only apply if all individuals performing qualified military service with
respect to the Employer (as determined under Code sections 414(b), (c), (m), and (o)) who die or became disabled as a result of
performing qualified military service (as defined in Code section 414(u)) before reemployment by the Employer are credited with
service and benefits on reasonably equivalent terms.
3. Determination of Benefits – The amount of Nondeductible Employee Contributions and the amount of Elective Deferrals of an
Employee treated as reemployed under Part A, item (1) for purposes of applying Code section 414(u)(8)(C) will be determined on
the basis of the individual’s average actual Nondeductible Employee Contributions or Elective Deferrals for the lesser of
a. the 12-month period of service with the Employer immediately before qualified military service (as defined in Code section
414(u)), or
b. if service with the Employer is less than such 12-month period, the actual length of continuous service with the Employer.
B. Vesting in the Case of Disability Resulting from Active Military Service
1. Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable) – If elected in the Adoption Agreement, for vesting purposes, an individual
who becomes disabled while performing qualified military service (as defined in Code section 414(u)) will be treated as if the
individual resumed employment in accordance with the individual’s reemployment rights under USERRA, on the day preceding
Disability (as applicable) and terminated employment on the actual date of Disability. If the Employer elects to treat an individual as
having resumed employment as described above, subject to item (2) below, compliance by the Plan with respect to the vesting
requirements will be treated for purposes of Code section 414(u)(1) as if such compliance were required under USERRA.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 74 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 80]
2. Nondiscrimination Requirements – Part B, item (1) above will apply to the extent permitted under other applicable rules, including
the rules provided in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3), which provides nondiscrimination rules for crediting imputed
service. Under Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3), the provisions crediting vesting service to any Highly Compensated
Employee must apply on the same terms to all similarly situated non-Highly Compensated Employees.
C. Death Benefits – In the case of an individual Participant who dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing qualified military
service (as defined in Code section 414(u)), the Participant’s survivors are entitled to any adEditional benefits (other than benefit
accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) provided under the Plan had the Participant resumed employment with the
Employer and then terminated employment on account of death.
7.26 MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLAN
If allowed by the Adopting Employer, the Plan may also be adopted by employers that are not Related Employers of the Adopting Employer.
Such employers will adopt the Plan by completing a Participating Employer Election Attachment. If the Adopting Employer allows the Plan to
have Unrelated Participating Employers, the Plan will be considered a multiple eLmployer plan and will be subject to the specific reporting
requirements and rules of Code section 413(c) and the corresponding regulations.
A. Service – For purposes of eligibility and vesting service under the Plan, the Adopting Employer and all Participating Employers will be
considered a single employer. An Employee’s service includes all service with the Adopting Employer and any Participating Employer(s)
(and with any employer that is a Related Employer of the Adopting Employer or Participating Employer(s)). An Employee who discontinues
service with the Adopting Employer or a Participating Employer will no longer be considered to have a Severance from Employment or
Termination of Employment upon resuming servicPe with the Adopting Employer or a Participating Employer.
B. Testing – For purposes of the limitations under the Plan relating to the requirements of Code sections 415, 402(g), and 414(v) the
Adopting Employer and all Participating Employers will be considered a single employer. The requirements of Code sections 410(b),
401(a)(4), 401(k)(3)(A)(ii), 401(m)(2)(A), 414(q), and 416 will be applied separately to the Adopting Employer and to each Participating
Employer, except as required under Code sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o). For purposes of determining a Participant’s Required
Beginning Date, a Participant will be considered a five-percent owner in a year in which the Participant is both a five-percent owner
and an Employee of the Adopting Employer or a Participating Employer.
M
C. Plan Document and Amendments – Except to the extent that the Participating Employer elects separate provisions on a
Participating Employer Election Attachment with respect to its Employees, the Participating Employer will be bound by the terms of
the Plan and trust, including amendments thereto and any elections made by the Adopting Employer. If a Participating Employer so
elects on a Participating Employer Election Attachment, Employer Contributions will be determined by the Participating Employer and
will be allocated only to Participants employed by the Participating Employer. If a Participating Employer so elects on a Participating
Employer Election Attachment, Forfeitures related to the Participating Employer will be allocated only to Participants employed by the
Participating Employer.
D. Duties of the Participating Employer and Indemnification – Each Participating Employer agrees to provide, in a timely manner, all
Ainformation and contributions to the Plan Administrator that the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion deems necessary to keep the
Plan operating in compliance with all Code and regulatory requirements.
Notwithstanding any provisions hereof, each Participating Employer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Plan
Administrator, the Adopting Employer, the Plan, all Participants and Beneficiaries, all Fiduciaries, and their respective directors, managers,
officers, employees, agents and other representatives harmless from any loss, costs, expenses, fees, liabilities, damages, claims, suits, or
actions and appeals thereof resulting from their reliance upon any certificate, notice, confirmation, or instruction purporting to have been
delivered by a representative of a Participating Employer that has been duly identified to the Plan Administrator or Adopting Employer in
Sa manner required or accepted by such Plan Administrator or Adopting Employer (“Designated Representative”). Each Participating
Employer waives any and all claims of any nature it now has or may have against the Plan Administrator or Adopting Employer and its
affiliates, and their respective directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, and other representatives, which arise, directly or indirectly,
from any action that it takes in good faith in accordance with any certificate, notice, confirmation, or instruction from a Designated
Representative of a Participating Employer. Each Participating Employer also hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Plan
Administrator or Adopting Employer, and any parent, subsidiary, related corporation, or affiliates of the Plan Administrator or Adopting
Employer, including their respective directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, and other representatives, harmless from and
against any and all loss, costs, damages, liability, expenses, or claims of any nature whatsoever, including but not limited to legal
expenses, court costs, legal fees, and costs of investigation, including appeals thereof, arising, directly or indirectly, out of any loss or
diminution of the Fund resulting from changes in the market value of the Fund assets; reliance, or action taken in reliance, on instructions
from a Participating Employer or its Designated Representative; any exercise or failure to exercise investment direction authority by a
Participating Employer or by its Designated Representative; Plan Administrator’s or Adopting Employer’s refusal on advice of counsel to
act in accordance with any investment direction by a Participating Employer or its Designated Representative; any other act or failure to
act by a Participating Employer or its Designated Representative; any prohibited transaction or plan disqualification of a qualified plan
due to any actions taken or not taken by the Plan Administrator or Adopting Employer, in reliance on instructions from a Participating
Employer or its Designated Representative; or any other act the Plan Administrator or Adopting Employer, takes in good faith hereunder
that arises under the Plan or the administration of the Fund.
The Plan Administrator or Adopting Employer will not be liable to a Participating Employer for any act, omission, or determination
made in connection with the Plan except for its gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Plan Administrator or Adopting Employer will not be liable for any losses arising from its compliance with instructions
from a Participating Employer or its Designated Representative; for executing, failing to execute, failing to timely execute, or for any
mistake in the execution of any instructions, unless such action or inaction is by reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Plan Administrator or Adopting Employer.
#3000 (Rev. 6/2020) Page 75 ©2020 Ascensus, LLC

[PAGE 81]
The provisions of this Plan Section 7.26(D) will survive the termination or amendment of the Plan.
E. Termination – A Participating Employer will have the right to cease participation in the Plan at any time by giving written notice to the
Adopting Employer. The termination of participation will become effective thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice unless a different
period is agreed upon by both the Adopting Employer and the Participating Employer. The Adopting Employer will have the power to
terminate the participation in the Plan of any Participating Employer at any time by giving written notice to such Participating Employer.
The termination will become effective thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice unless a diffEerent period is agreed upon by both the
Adopting Employer and the Participating Employer. Upon termination of participation, Employees of the former Participating Employer
will cease to accrue further benefits under the Plan pertaining to the former Participating Employer. Upon termination of participation of
a Participating Employer, the Participating Employer must promptly contribute to the Plan such amounts as necessary to cover accrued
but unfunded contributions related to its Participants under the Plan.
A Participating Employer’s termination of participation is not a termination of the Plan which allows distributions to be made to
Participants. Upon termination of participation of a Participating Employer, the Adopting Employer has the right, but not the duty, to
L
establish a new qualified retirement plan for the benefit of the Participants of such former Participating Employer and to initiate a
non-elective transfer to the spin-off plan. The Adopting Employer may, in its sole discretion, appoint either itself or the former
Participating Employer as the Adopting Employer and/or Plan Administrator of the spin-off plan. If a spin-off plan is not established,
the former Participating Employer has the right, but not the duty, to initiate a non-elective transfer to another qualified retirement
plan that the former Participating Employer either maintains or participates in. The former Participating Employer will bear all
reasonable costs associated with ceasing participation in the Plan.
P
SECTION EIGHT: ADOPTING EMPLOYER SIGNATURE
Adoption Agreement Section Eight must contain the signature of an authorized representative of the Adopting Employer evidencing the Employer’s
agreement to be bound by the terms of the Basic Plan Document and Adoption Agreement.
