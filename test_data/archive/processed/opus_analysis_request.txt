DOCUMENT ANALYSIS REQUEST FOR OPUS 4.1
================================================================================

CONTEXT:
I'm building an AI tool to compare retirement plan documents during conversions.
I have 4 documents that I categorized as follows:

  • Document 1: pair_a_source_bpd.pdf (81 pages)
    Assumed: Basic Plan Document (BPD) - SOURCE/OLD document

  • Document 2: pair_a_target_bpd.pdf (98 pages)
    Assumed: Basic Plan Document (BPD) - TARGET/NEW document

  • Document 3: pair_b_source_adoption.pdf
    Assumed: Adoption Agreement - SOURCE/OLD

  • Document 4: pair_b_target_adoption_locked.pdf
    Assumed: Adoption Agreement - TARGET/NEW (password-protected)

================================================================================
PROBLEM:
================================================================================

My semantic mapping algorithm found 0% matches between Documents 1 and 2.
Even when checking ALL possible pairings, the LLM said 'no match' with 100%
confidence. This makes me suspect I misunderstood the document structure.

QUESTIONS FOR OPUS:
================================================================================

1. DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION:
   - Did I correctly identify these as BPD documents?
   - Are they from the same vendor or different vendors?
   - Should Document 1 and Document 2 be compared directly, or do they
     require companion Adoption Agreements to be meaningful?

2. STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
   For Document 1:
   - Are the eligibility/vesting provisions self-contained with specific
     values, or do they reference an Adoption Agreement?
   - What pages contain the OPERATIONAL eligibility provisions?
   - What pages contain the OPERATIONAL vesting provisions?

   For Document 2:
   - Same questions as Document 1
   - Why do many provisions say 'as elected in the Adoption Agreement'?
   - Is this a template/prototype document that REQUIRES an Adoption
     Agreement to specify actual plan terms?

3. SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE TEST:
   Compare these specific pairs and tell me if they're semantically
   equivalent (same meaning/purpose):

   a) Doc1 Section 2.01 (Eligibility to Participate)
      vs
      Doc2 Section 3.1 (CONDITIONS OF ELIGIBILITY)

      Should these match? Why or why not?

   b) Doc1 Section 4.02 (100 Percent Vesting of Certain Contributions)
      vs
      Doc2 Section 13.5 (VESTING REQUIREMENTS)

      Should these match? Why or why not?

4. MISSING MATCHES:
   For each of the 5 provisions I extracted from Document 1, please
   identify the BEST matching provision in Document 2 (if any exists).
   Include the section number and explain why it's a match.

5. EXTRACTION VALIDATION:
   - Did I extract the right provisions (operational, not definitional)?
   - Are there better/clearer provisions I should have extracted?
   - Did I miss obvious matches because I extracted from the wrong sections?

6. COMPARISON STRATEGY:
   Given the structure of these documents, what's the correct way to
   compare them for a plan conversion project?
   - BPD to BPD directly?
   - BPD + Adoption Agreement (combined) to BPD + Adoption Agreement?
   - Something else?

================================================================================
ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
================================================================================

My algorithm uses:
1. OpenAI text-embedding-3-small to create vector embeddings (cosine similarity)
2. GPT-4.1 to verify semantic equivalence of top candidates
3. Only provision_text is embedded (no metadata like section numbers)

Expected outcome: 70-90% of provisions should match (with some variances)
Actual outcome: 0% matches, even when checking all 25 possible pairings

This suggests either:
- I misidentified the documents (wrong pairing)
- I'm comparing incompatible document types (BPD vs Adoption Agreement)
- The documents genuinely have no semantic overlap (unlikely)
- My LLM is too strict in its matching criteria
