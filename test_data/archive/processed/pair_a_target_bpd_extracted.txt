Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
ARTICLE I
DEFINITIONS
As used in this Plan, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings set forth herein unless a different meaning is clearly
required by the context:
1.1 "Account" means any separate notational account established and maintained by the Administrator for each Participant under the
Plan. To the extent applicable, a Participant may have any (or all) of the following notational Accounts:
(a) "Combined Account" means the account representing the Participant's total interest under the Plan resulting from (1) the
Employer's contributions in the case of a Profit Sharing Plan or Money Purchase Plan, and (2) the Employer Nonelective
Contributions in the case of a 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan. In addition, Forfeitures are part of the Combined Account to the extent they
are reallocated. Separate accountings shall be maintained with respect to that portion of a Participant's Account attributable to
Employer contributions made pursuant to Section 12.1(a)(2) and to Employer contributions made pursuant to Section 12.1(a)(3).
(b) "Elective Deferral Account" means the account established hereunder to which Elective Deferrals (including a separate
accounting for Catch-Up Contributions) are allocated. Amounts in the Participant's Elective Deferral Account are nonforfeitable when
made and are subject to the distribution restrictions of Section 12.2(e). The Elective Deferral Account may consist of the
sub-Accounts listed below. Unless specifically stated otherwise, any reference to a Participant's Elective Deferral Account will refer to
both of these sub-Accounts.
(1) "Pre-Tax Elective Deferral Account" means the portion of the Elective Deferral Account attributable to Pre-Tax Elective
Deferrals (i.e., Elective Deferrals that are not subject to federal income tax at the time of their deferral to the Plan).
(2) "Roth Elective Deferral Account" means the portion of the Elective Deferral Account attributable to Roth Elective Deferrals
(i.e., that are subject to federal income tax at the time of their deferral to the Plan) which does not include amounts attributable to
"in-Plan Roth rollover contributions" (as defined in Section 12.11). No contributions other than Roth Elective Deferrals and
properly attributable earnings will be credited to each Participant's Roth Elective Deferral Account.
(c) "In-Plan Roth Rollover Account" means the account attributable to an "in-Plan Roth rollover contribution" (an IRR) that is
directly rolled over within this Plan, as defined and described in Section 12.11. The amount thus contributed retains the characteristics
of the source Account from which the amount of the IRR was distributed (except for the tax treatment of such amount when
distributed out of the Plan).
(d) "In-Plan Roth Transfer Account" means the account attributable an "in-Plan Roth rollover transfer" (an IRT) that is directly
rolled over within this Plan, as defined and described in Section 12.11. The amount thus contributed retains the characteristics of the
source Account from which the amount of the IRT was distributed (except for the tax treatment of such amount when distributed out
of the Plan).
(e) "Qualified Automatic Contribution Safe Harbor Account" means the account established hereunder to which Qualified Automatic
Contribution "ADP test safe harbor contributions" are allocated. Amounts in the Qualified Automatic Contribution Safe Harbor
Account are subject to the distribution restrictions of Section 12.2(e). The Administrator may maintain a separate Qualified Automatic
Contribution Safe Harbor Account for matching contributions and nonelective contributions made pursuant to a QACA.
(f) "Qualified Matching Contribution Account" means the account established hereunder to which Qualified Matching Contributions
are allocated. Amounts in the Qualified Matching Contribution Account are nonforfeitable when made and are subject to the
distribution restrictions of Section 12.2(e).
(g) "Qualified Nonelective Contribution Account" means the account established hereunder to which Qualified Nonelective
Contributions are allocated. Amounts in the Qualified Nonelective Contribution Account are nonforfeitable when made and are
subject to the distribution restrictions of Section 12.2(e).
(h) "Qualified Voluntary Employee Contribution Account" means the account established hereunder to which a Participant's tax-
deductible qualified voluntary Employee contributions made pursuant to Section 4.9 are allocated.
(i) "Rollover Account" means the account established hereunder to which amounts transferred from a qualified plan (including this
Plan) or individual retirement account in accordance with Section 4.6 are allocated.
(j) "Transfer Account" means the account established hereunder to which amounts transferred to this Plan from a direct plan-to-plan
transfer in accordance with Section 4.7 are allocated.

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(k) "Voluntary Contribution Account" means the account established hereunder to which after-tax voluntary Employee contributions
made pursuant to Section 4.8 are allocated. Amounts recharacterized as after-tax voluntary Employee contributions pursuant to
Section 12.5 shall remain subject to the limitations of Section 12.2. Therefore, a separate accounting shall be maintained with respect
to that portion of the Voluntary Contribution Account attributable to after-tax voluntary Employee contributions made pursuant to
Section 4.8.
1.2 "ACP" means the "Actual Contribution Percentage" determined pursuant to Section 12.6(d).
1.3 "Act" means the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as it may be amended from time to time and includes applicable
Department of Labor (DOL) guidance.
1.4 "ADP" means the "Actual Deferral Percentage" determined pursuant to Section 12.4(d).
1.5 "Administrator" means the Employer unless another person, entity or committee has been designated by the Employer pursuant to
Section 2.2 to administer the Plan on behalf of the Employer. "Administrator" also includes any Qualified Termination Administrator
(QTA) that has assumed the responsibilities of the Administrator in accordance with guidelines set forth by the Department of Labor.
1.6 "Adoption Agreement" means the separate agreement which is executed by the Employer and sets forth the elective provisions of
this Plan as specified by the Employer.
1.7 "Affiliated Employer" means any corporation which is a member of a controlled group of corporations (as defined in Code Â§414(b))
which includes the Employer; any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is under common control (as defined in Code
Â§414(c)) with the Employer; any organization (whether or not incorporated) which is a member of an affiliated service group (as defined in
Code Â§414(m)) which includes the Employer; and any other entity required to be aggregated with the Employer pursuant to Regulations
under Code Â§414(o).
1.8 "Affirmative Election" means a Salary Deferral Agreement submitted by a Participant to the Administrator in accordance with
Section 12.2 that provides instructions to defer a specific amount of Compensation (including an affirmative election to defer no amount)
as an Elective Deferral to the Plan. A Participant's Affirmative Election is generally effective as of the first payroll period which follows
the payroll period in which the Participant made the Affirmative Election. However, a Participant may make an Affirmative Election which
is effective: (a) for the first payroll period in which he or she becomes a Participant if the Participant makes an Affirmative Election within
a reasonable period following the Participant's becoming eligible to make Elective Deferrals and before the Compensation to which the
Election applies becomes currently available; or (b) for the first payroll period following the effective date of the Automatic Contribution
Arrangement if the Participant makes an Affirmative Election not later than the Automatic Contribution Arrangement's effective date.
1.9 "Alternate Payee" means an alternate payee pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order that meets the requirements of
Code Â§414(p).
1.10 "Anniversary Date" means the last day of the Plan Year.
1.11 "Annuity Starting Date" means, with respect to any Participant, the first day of the first period for which an amount is paid as an
annuity, or, in the case of a benefit not payable in the form of an annuity, the first day on which all events have occurred which entitles the
Participant to such benefit.
1.12 "Automatic Contribution Arrangement" means the Automatic Deferral provisions described by Section 12.2 and, if applicable,
Section 12.9.
1.13 "Automatic Deferral" means the amount (if any) that a Participant is deemed to defer in accordance with an Automatic Contribution
Arrangement. The effective date of an Employee's Automatic Deferral will be as soon as practicable after the Employee is subject to
Automatic Deferrals described by the Adoption Agreement, Section 12.2(b) and/or 12.9, consistent with (a) applicable law, and (b) the
objective of affording the Employee a reasonable period of time after receipt of the notice to make an Affirmative Election (and, if
applicable, an investment election). All Automatic Deferrals constitute Elective Deferrals.
1.14 "Beneficiary" means the person (or entity) to whom all or a portion of a deceased Participant's interest in the Plan is, or may become,
payable upon the Participantâs death as identified in records maintained by the Plan, subject to the restrictions of Sections 6.2 and 6.6.
1.15 "Catch-Up Contribution" means an Elective Deferral made to the Plan by a Catch-Up Eligible Participant that, during any taxable
year of such Participant, exceeds one of the following:
(a) a statutory dollar limit on Elective Deferrals or "annual additions" as provided in Code Â§401(a)(30), 402(h), 403(b), 408, 415(c),
or 457(b)(2) (without regard to Code Â§457(b)(3)), as applicable; or
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers
2

[PAGE 8]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(b) any Plan limit on Elective Deferrals (other than a limit described in (a) above) that applies to Elective Deferrals without regard to
Catch-up Contributions, such as the limits on annual additions, the dollar limitation on Elective Deferrals under Code Â§402(g) (not
counting Catch-up Contributions) and the limit imposed by the ADP test under Code Â§401(k)(3). Catch-up Contributions for a
participant for a taxable year may not exceed the lesser of: (1) the dollar limit on Catch-up Contributions under Code Â§414(v)(2)(B)(i)
for the taxable year; or (2) when added to other Elective Deferrals, 100 percent of the Participant's Compensation for the taxable year.
Catch-Up Contributions for a Participant for a Participant's taxable year may not exceed the dollar limit on Catch-Up Contributions
under Code Â§414(v) for the Participant's taxable year. The dollar limit on Catch-Up Contributions under Code Â§414(v)(2)(B)(i) was $5,000
for taxable years beginning in 2006. After 2006, the $5,000 limit was adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for cost-of-living increases
under Code Â§414(v)(2)(C) and is $6,000 for 2018. Any such adjustments shall be in multiples of $500. Notwithstanding the preceding,
different dollar limits apply to Catch-Up Contributions under SIMPLE 401(k) plans ($3,000 for 2018).
1.16 "Catch-Up Eligible Participant" means a Participant who:
(a) is eligible to make Elective Deferrals to the Plan pursuant to Section 12.2; and
(b) will attain age 50 or older by the end of such taxable year.
1.17 "Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as it may be amended from time to time and includes applicable Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) guidance.
1.18 "Compensation" means, with respect to any Participant, the amount determined in accordance with the following provisions, except
as otherwise provided in the Adoption Agreement.
(a) Base definition. One of the following, as elected in the Adoption Agreement:
(1) Information required to be reported under Code Â§Â§6041, 6051 and 6052 (Wages, tips and other compensation as reported on
Form W-2). Compensation means wages, within the meaning of Code Â§3401(a), and all other payments of compensation to an
Employee by the Employer (in the course of the Employer's trade or business) for which the Employer is required to furnish the
Employee a written statement under Code Â§Â§6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052. Compensation must be determined without regard to
any rules under Code Â§3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment
or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Â§3401(a)(2)).
(2) Code Â§3401(a) Wages. Compensation means an Employee's wages within the meaning of Code Â§3401(a) for the purposes of
income tax withholding at the source but determined without regard to any rules that limit the remuneration included in wages
based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code
Â§3401(a)(2)).
(3) 415 safe harbor compensation. Compensation means wages, salaries, Military Differential Pay, and fees for professional
services and other amounts received (without regard to whether or not an amount is paid in cash) for personal services actually
rendered in the course of employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan to the extent that the amounts are includible in
gross income (including, but not limited to, commissions paid salespersons, compensation for services on the basis of a
percentage of profits, commissions on insurance premiums, tips, bonuses, fringe benefits, and reimbursements, or other expense
allowances under a nonaccountable plan (as described in Regulation Â§1.62-2(c))), and excluding the following:
(i) Employer contributions to a plan of deferred compensation which are not includible in the Employee's gross income for
the taxable year in which contributed, or Employer contributions under a simplified employee pension plan to the extent
such contributions are excludable from the Employee's gross income, or any distributions from a plan of deferred
compensation;
(ii) Amounts realized from the exercise of a nonqualified stock option, or when restricted stock (or property) held by the
Employee either becomes freely transferable or is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture;
(iii) Amounts realized from the sale, exchange or other disposition of stock acquired under a qualified stock option; and
(iv) Other amounts which receive special tax benefits, such as premiums for group term life insurance (but only to the
extent that the premiums are not includible in the gross income of the Employee and are not salary reduction amounts under
Code Â§125), whether or not the contributions are actually excludable from the gross income of the Employee).
(b) Earned Income for Self-Employed Individual. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Compensation for any Self-Employed
Individual shall be equal to Earned Income. Furthermore, the contributions on behalf of any "owner-Employee" shall be made only
with respect to the Earned Income for such "owner-Employee" which is derived from the trade or business with respect to which such
Plan is established. For this purpose, an "owner-Employee" means a sole proprietor who owns the entire interest in the Employer or a
partner (or member in the case of a limited liability company treated as a partnership or sole proprietorship for federal income tax
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers

[PAGE 9]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
purposes) who owns more than ten percent (10%) of either the capital interest or the profits interest in the Employer and who receives
income for personal services from the Employer.
(c) Paid during "determination period." Compensation shall include only that Compensation which is actually paid to the
Participant during the "determination period." Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, the "determination period" is the period
elected by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement. If the Employer makes no election, the "determination period" shall be the Plan
Year.
(d) Inclusion of deferrals. Notwithstanding the above, unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, Compensation shall
include all of the following types of elective contributions and all of the following types of deferred compensation:
(1) Elective contributions that are made by the Employer on behalf of a Participant that are not includible in gross income under
Code Â§Â§125, 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), 403(b), and 132(f)(4). However, regardless of any election in the Adoption
Agreement to the contrary, amounts described in the preceding sentence will be included in Compensation for purposes of
making Elective Deferrals under this Plan. If specified in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective Dates and
Other Permitted Elections), amounts under Code Â§125 shall be deemed to include any amounts not available to a Participant in
cash in lieu of group health coverage because the Participant is unable to certify that he or she has other health coverage. An
amount will be treated as an amount under Code Â§125 pursuant to the preceding sentence only if the Employer does not request
or collect information regarding the Participant's other health coverage as part of the enrollment process for the health plan.
(2) Compensation deferred under an eligible deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Code Â§457(b).
(3) Employee contributions (under governmental plans) described in Code Â§414(h)(2) that are picked up by the employing unit
and thus are treated as Employer contributions.
(e) Post-severance compensation â Code Â§415 Regulations. The Administrator shall adjust Compensation for amounts that would
otherwise be included in the definition of Compensation but are paid by the later of 2 1/2 months after a Participant's severance from
employment with the Employer or the end of the Plan Year that includes the date of the Participant's severance from employment with
the Employer, in accordance with the following, as elected in the Compensation Section of the Adoption Agreement. The preceding
time period, however, does not apply with respect to payments described in Subsections (4) and (5) below. Any other payment of
compensation paid after severance of employment that is not described in the following types of compensation is not considered
Compensation, even if payment is made within the time period specified above.
(1) Regular pay. Compensation shall include regular pay after severance of employment (to the extent otherwise included in
the definition of Compensation) if:
(i) The payment is regular compensation for services during the Participant's regular working hours, or compensation for
services outside the Participant's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses, or
other similar payments; and
(ii) The payment would have been paid to the Participant prior to a severance from employment if the Participant had
continued in employment with the Employer.
(2) Leave cash-outs. Compensation shall include leave cash-outs if those amounts would have been included in the
definition of Compensation if they were paid prior to the Participant's severance from employment with the Employer, and the
amounts are for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation, or other leave, but only if the Participant would have been able to use
the leave if employment had continued.
(3) Deferred compensation. Compensation shall include deferred compensation if those amounts would have been included
in the definition of Compensation if they were paid prior to the Participant's severance from employment with the Employer,
and the amounts are received pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan, but only if the payment would
have been paid at the same time if the Participant had continued in employment with the Employer and only to the extent the
payment is includible in the Participant's gross income.
(4) Military Differential pay. Compensation shall include payments to an individual who does not currently perform
services for the Employer by reason of qualified military service (as that term is used in Code Â§414(u)(1)) to the extent those
payments do not exceed the amounts the individual would have received if the individual had continued to perform services for
the Employer rather than entering qualified military service.
(5) Disability pay. Compensation shall include compensation paid to a Participant who is permanently and totally disabled,
as defined in Code Â§22(e)(3), provided, as elected by the Employer in the Compensation Section of the Adoption Agreement,
salary continuation applies to all Participants who are permanently and totally disabled for a fixed or determinable period, or
the Participant was not a Highly Compensated Employee immediately before becoming disabled.

(f) Compensation Dollar limitation. For any Plan Year (or other applicable determination period) Compensation in excess of
$200,000 shall be disregarded for all purposes other than for purposes of Elective Deferrals, except that the Administrator may impose
the limit for purposes of a Plan imposed limit on Elective Deferrals. The dollar amount shall be adjusted by the Commissioner for
increases in the cost-of-living in accordance with Code Â§401(a)(17)(B) and is $275,000 for 2018. The cost-of-living adjustment in
effect for a calendar year applies to any "determination period" beginning with or within such calendar year. If a "determination
period" consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the $275,000 annual Compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of months in the "determination period," and the denominator of which is twelve (12). In applying
any Plan limitation on the amount of matching contributions or any Plan limit on Elective Deferrals which are subject to matching
contributions, where such limits are expressed as a percentage of Compensation, the Administrator may apply the Compensation limit
under this Section annually, even if the matching contribution formula is applied on any time interval which is less than the full Plan
Year or the Administrator may pro rate the Compensation limit.
(g) Noneligible Employee. If, in the Adoption Agreement, the Employer elects to exclude a class of Employees from the Plan, then
Compensation for any Employee who becomes eligible or ceases to be eligible to participate during a "determination period" shall
only include Compensation while the Employee is an Eligible Employee. In addition, with respect to the determination of any
matching contributions, the Plan will disregard Elective Deferrals made while the Participant is not eligible for the matching
contribution component of the Plan.
(h) Amendment. If, in connection with the adoption of any amendment, the definition of Compensation has been modified, then,
except as otherwise provided herein, for Plan Years prior to the Plan Year which includes the adoption date of such amendment,
Compensation means compensation determined pursuant to the terms of the Plan then in effect.
(i) Affiliated Employers. Affiliated Employers are treated as one Employer for purposes of Compensation. If, however, one or
more Affiliated Employers are Participating Employers and the Plan (including the Adoption Agreement or a participation agreement)
allocate Employer Contributions separately among the Employees directly employed by a Participating Employer, then, in computing
such allocations, Compensation paid by other Participating Employers is excluded Compensation.
1.19 "Contract" or "Policy" means any life insurance policy, retirement income policy, or annuity contract (group or individual) issued
by the Insurer. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Plan and the terms of any contract purchased hereunder, the Plan
provisions shall control.
1.20 "Custodian" means a person or entity that has custody of all or any portion of the Plan assets.
1.21 "Directed Trustee" means a Trustee who, with respect to the investment of Plan assets, is subject to the direction of the
Administrator, the Employer, a properly appointed Investment Manager, a named Fiduciary, or Plan Participant.
1.22 "Discretionary Trustee" means a Trustee who has the authority and discretion to invest, manage or control any portion of the Plan
assets.
1.23 "Early Retirement Date" means the date specified in the Adoption Agreement on which a Participant has satisfied the requirements
specified in the Adoption Agreement (Early Retirement Age). If elected in the Adoption Agreement, a Participant shall become fully
Vested upon satisfying such requirements if the Participant is still employed at the Early Retirement Age.
A Participant who severs from employment after satisfying any service requirement but before satisfying the age requirement for
Early Retirement Age and who thereafter reaches the age requirement contained herein shall be entitled to receive benefits under this Plan
(other than any accelerated vesting and allocations of Employer contributions) as though the requirements for Early Retirement Age had
been satisfied.
1.24 "Earned Income" means the net earnings from self-employment in the trade or business with respect to which the Plan is established,
for which the personal services of the individual are a material income-producing factor. Net earnings will be determined without regard to
items not included in gross income and the deductions allocable to such items. Net earnings are reduced by contributions by the employer
to a qualified plan to the extent deductible under Â§404 of the Code. The Administrator will determine net earnings after the deduction
allowed to the Self-Employed Individual for all contributions made by the Employer to a qualified plan and after the deduction allowed to
the Self-Employed Individual under Code Â§164(f) for self-employment taxes.
If Compensation is defined to exclude any items of Compensation (other than safe harbor adjustments permitted under the
Code Â§414(s) Regulations or limiting Compensation to periods of Plan participation), then for purposes of determining the Compensation
of a Self-Employed Individual, Earned Income shall be adjusted by multiplying Earned Income by the percentage of total compensation
that is included for the eligible Participants who are Nonhighly Compensated Employees. That percentage is determined by calculating the
percentage of each eligible Nonhighly Compensated Participant's total Compensation prior to excluding any non-safe harbor adjustments
selected in the Adjustments to Compensation Section of the Adoption Agreement that are included in the definition of Compensation and
averaging those percentages.

1.25 "Effective Date" means the date this Plan, including any restatement or amendment of this Plan, is effective. Where the Plan is
restated or amended, a reference to Effective Date is the effective date of the restatement or amendment, except where the context indicates
a reference to an earlier Effective Date. If any provision of this Plan is retroactively effective, then provisions of this Plan generally control.
However, if a provision of this Plan is different from the provision of the Employer's prior plan document and, after the retroactive
Effective Date of this Plan, the Employer operated in compliance with the provisions of the prior plan, then the provision of such prior plan
is incorporated into this Plan for purposes of determining whether the Employer operated the Plan in compliance with its terms, provided
operation in compliance with the terms of the prior plan do not violate any qualification requirements under the Code, Regulations, or other
IRS guidance.
The Employer may designate special effective dates for individual provisions under the Plan where provided in the Adoption
Agreement or under Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective Dates and Other Permitted Elections). If one or more
qualified retirement plans have been merged into this Plan, the provisions of the merging plan(s) will remain in full force and effect until
the effective date of the plan merger(s).
1.26 "Elective Deferrals" means the Employer's contributions to the Plan that are made pursuant to a Participant's salary deferral election
in accordance with Section 12.2. Elective Deferrals shall be subject to the requirements of Sections 12.2(d) and 12.2(e) and shall, except as
otherwise provided herein, be required to satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements of the Code Â§401(k) Regulations. The term "Elective
Deferrals" includes Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and, if permitted by the Plan, Roth Elective Deferrals.
1.27 "Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangement" (EACA) means an Automatic Contribution Arrangement that is intended to
comply as such for purposes of Code Â§414(w) and that therefore complies with the Automatic Deferral provisions described in the EACA
provisions set forth in Section 12.2(b).
1.28 "Eligible Employee" means any Eligible Employee as elected in the Adoption Agreement and as provided herein.
(a) "Reclassified Employees." With respect to a non-standardized Adoption Agreement, an individual shall not be an Eligible
Employee (unless otherwise elected in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement) if such individual is a "Reclassified Employee. " A
"Reclassified Employee" is any person the Employer does not treat as a common law employee or as a self-employed individual
(including, but not limited to, independent contractors, persons the Employer pays outside of its payroll system and out-sourced
workers) for federal income tax withholding purposes under Code Â§3401(a), irrespective of whether there is a binding determination
that the individual is an Employee or a Leased Employee of the Employer. Self-Employed Individuals are not "Reclassified
Employees."
(b) Affiliated Employers. With respect to a non-standardized Adoption Agreement, Employees of an Affiliated Employer will not
be treated as Eligible Employees prior to the date the Affiliated Employer adopts the Plan as a Participating Employer.
(c) "Code Â§410(b)(6)(C) transactions." Employees who became Employees as the result of a "Code Â§410(b)(6)(C) transaction"
will, unless otherwise specified in the Adoption Agreement, only be Eligible Employees after the expiration of the transition period
beginning on the date of the transaction and ending on the last day of the first Plan Year beginning after the date of the transaction. A
"Code Â§410(b)(6)(C) transaction" is an asset or stock acquisition, merger, or similar transaction involving a change in the Employer of
the Employees of a trade or business that is subject to the special rules set forth in Code Â§410(b)(6)(C). However, regardless of any
election made in the Adoption Agreement, if a separate entity becomes an Affiliated Employer as the result of a "Code Â§410(b)(6)(C)
transaction," then Employees of such separate entity will not be treated as Eligible Employees prior to the date the entity adopts the
Plan as a Participating Employer or, with respect to a standardized Adoption Agreement, if earlier, the expiration of the transition
period set forth above.
(d) Union Employees. If, in the Adoption Agreement, the Employer elects to exclude union employees, then Employees whose
employment is governed by a collective bargaining agreement between the Employer and "employee representatives" under which
retirement benefits were the subject of good faith bargaining and if two percent (2%) or less of the Employees covered pursuant to that
agreement are professionals as defined in Regulation Â§1.410(b)-9, shall not be eligible to participate in this Plan to the extent of
employment covered by such agreement, unless the agreement provides for coverage in the Plan (see Section 4.1(d)). For this purpose,
the term "employee representatives" does not include any organization more than half of whose members are employees who are
owners, officers, or executives of the Employer. If a Participant performs services both as a collectively bargained Employee and as a
non-collectively bargained Employee, then the Participant's Hours of Service in each respective category are treated separately.
(e) Nonresident aliens. If, in the Adoption Agreement, the Employer elects to exclude nonresident aliens, then Employees who are
nonresident aliens (within the meaning of Code Â§7701(b)(1)(B)) who received no earned income (within the meaning of Code
Â§911(d)(2)) from the Employer which constitutes income from sources within the United States (within the meaning of Code
Â§861(a)(3)) shall not be eligible to participate in this Plan. In addition, this paragraph shall also apply to exclude from participation in
the Plan an Employee who is a nonresident alien (within the meaning of Code Â§7701(b)(1)(B)) but who receives earned income
(within the meaning of Code Â§911(d)(2)) from the Employer that constitutes income from sources within the United States (within the
meaning of Code Â§861(a)(3)), if all of the Employee's earned income from the Employer from sources within the United States is
exempt from United States income tax under an applicable income tax convention. The preceding sentence will apply only if all
Employees described in the preceding sentence are excluded from the Plan.

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(f) Part-Time/Temporary/Seasonal Employees. If, in the Adoption Agreement, the Employer elects to exclude
Part-Time/Temporary/Seasonal Employees, then notwithstanding any such exclusion, if any such excluded Employee actually
completes or completed a Year of Service, then such Employee will cease to be within this particular excluded class. An Eligible
Employee who is no longer part of this excluded class because of this subsection will become a Participant in the Plan in accordance
with the Planâs eligibility and entry date provisions that apply to other Eligible Employees.
(g) Intern. The Employer in its Adoption Agreement may elect to exclude Employees that it defines in its payroll records as
âinterns.â The Employer will not apply this exclusion in a manner to effectively require an age or service condition in violation of
Treas. Reg. Â§1.401(a)-3(e)(1).
1.29 "Employee" means any person who is employed by the Employer. The term "Employee" shall also include any person who is an
employee of an Affiliated Employer and any Leased Employee deemed to be an Employee as provided in Code Â§414(n) or (o). In addition,
the term "Employee" also includes a statutory employee within the meaning of Code Â§3508(E) (certain life insurance salespersons).
1.30 "Employer" means the entity specified in the Adoption Agreement, any successor which shall maintain this Plan and any predecessor
which has maintained this Plan. In addition, unless the context means otherwise, the term "Employer" shall include any Participating
Employer which shall adopt this Plan.
1.31 "Excess Aggregate Contributions" means, with respect to any Plan Year, the excess of:
(a) The aggregate "contribution percentage amounts" (as defined in Section 12.6) actually made on behalf of Highly Compensated
Participants for such Plan Year and taken into account in computing the numerator of the ACP, over
(b) The maximum "contribution percentage amounts" permitted by the ACP test in Section 12.6 (determined by hypothetically
reducing contributions made on behalf of Highly Compensated Participants in order of their "contribution percentages" beginning with
the highest of such percentages).
Such determination shall be made after first taking into account corrections of any Excess Deferrals pursuant to Section 12.2 and then
taking into account adjustments of any Excess Contributions pursuant to Section 12.5.
1.32 "Excess Compensation" means, with respect to a Plan that is integrated with Social Security (permitted disparity), a Participant's
Compensation which is in excess of the integration level elected in the Adoption Agreement. However, if Compensation is based on less
than a twelve (12) month "determination period," Excess Compensation shall be determined by reducing the integration level by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of full months in the short period and the denominator of which is twelve (12). A "determination
period" is not less than twelve (12) months solely because a Participant's Compensation does not include Compensation paid during a
"determination period" while the Participant was not a Participant in this component of the Plan.
1.33 "Excess Contributions" means, with respect to any Plan Year, the excess of:
(a) The aggregate amount of Employer contributions actually made on behalf of Highly Compensated Participants for such Plan
Year and taken into account in computing the numerator of the ADP, over
(b) The maximum amount of such contributions permitted by the ADP test in Section 12.4 (determined by hypothetically reducing
contributions made on behalf of Highly Compensated Participants in order of the actual deferral ratios, beginning with the highest of
such ratios).
In determining the amount of Excess Contributions to be distributed and/or recharacterized with respect to an affected Highly
Compensated Participant as determined herein, such amount shall be reduced by any Excess Deferrals previously distributed to such
affected Highly Compensated Participant for the Participant's taxable year ending with or within such Plan Year.
1.34 "Excess Deferrals" means, with respect to any taxable year of a Participant, either (a) those elective deferrals within the meaning of
Code Â§Â§402(g) or 402A that are made during the Participant's taxable year and exceed the dollar limitation under Code Â§402(g) (including,
if applicable, the dollar limitation on Catch-Up Contributions defined in Code Â§414(v)) for such year; or (b) are made during a calendar
year and exceed the dollar limitation under Code Â§Â§402(g) and 402A (including, if applicable, the dollar limitation on Catch-Up
Contributions defined in Code Â§414(v)) for the Participant's taxable year beginning in such calendar year, counting only Elective Deferrals
made under this Plan and any other plan, contract or arrangement maintained by the Employer.
1.35 "Fiduciary" means any person who (a) exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of the
Plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets, (b) renders investment advice for a fee or
other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to any monies or other property of the Plan or has any authority or responsibility to do
so, or (c) has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of the Plan.
1.36 "Fiscal Year" means the Employer's accounting year.

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
1.37 "Forfeiture" means that portion of a Participant's Account that is not Vested and is disposed of in accordance with the provisions of
the Plan. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, Forfeitures occur pursuant to (a) below.
(a) A Forfeiture will occur on the earlier of:
(1) The last day of the Plan Year in which a Participant incurs five (5) consecutive 1-Year Breaks in Service, or
(2) The distribution of the entire Vested portion of the Participant's Account of a Participant who has severed employment with
the Employer. For purposes of this provision, if the Participant has a Vested benefit of zero, then such Participant shall be
deemed to have received a distribution of such Vested benefit as of the year in which the severance of employment occurs. For
this purpose, a Participant's Vested benefit shall not include: (i) the Participant's Qualified Voluntary Employee Contribution
Account, and (ii) the Participant's Rollover Account.
(b) If elected in the Adoption Agreement, a Forfeiture will occur as of the last day of the Plan Year in which a Participant incurs
five (5) consecutive 1-Year Breaks in Service.
Regardless of the preceding, if a Participant is eligible to share in the allocation of Forfeitures in the year in which the Forfeiture
would otherwise occur, then the Forfeiture will not occur until the end of the first Plan Year for which the Participant is not eligible to share
in the allocation of Forfeitures. Furthermore, the term "Forfeiture" shall also include amounts deemed to be Forfeitures pursuant to any
other provision of this Plan.
1.38 "Former Employee" means an individual who has severed employment with the Employer or an Affiliated Employer.
1.39 "414(s) Compensation" means Compensation as defined in Section 1.18. However, the Employer may operationally elect to use any
other definition of compensation for 414(s) Compensation provided such definition satisfies the nondiscrimination requirements of Code
Â§414(s) and the Regulations thereunder. Solely for purposes of the definition of compensation used for ADP/ ACP testing, it is permissible
for the plan to set forth one definition of compensation that satisfies Code Â§414(s), as long as such definition is uniformly applied. For
purposes of applying the ADP and ACP tests, the period for determining 414(s) Compensation must be either the Plan Year or the calendar
year ending with or within the Plan Year. For all other purposes, the period of determining 414(s) Compensation must be the Plan Year or
another twelve (12) month period of time ending in the Plan Year. An Employer may further limit the period taken into account to that part
of the determination period in which an Employee was a Participant in the component of the Plan being tested. The period used to
determine 414(s) Compensation must be applied uniformly to all Participants for the Plan Year.
1.40 "415 Compensation" means, with respect to any Participant, such Participant's (a) Wages, tips and other compensation on Form
W-2, (b) Code Â§3401(a) wages or (c) 415 safe harbor compensation as elected in the Adoption Agreement for purposes of Compensation
(and as defined in Subsections 1.18(a)(1)-(3) respectively). Compensation for any Self-Employed Individual shall be equal to Earned
Income. Furthermore, the contributions on behalf of any "owner-Employee" shall be made only with respect to the Earned Income for such
"owner-Employee" which is derived from the trade or business with respect to which such Plan is established. For this purpose, an "owner-
Employee" means a sole proprietor who owns the entire interest in the Employer or a partner (or member in the case of a limited liability
company treated as a partnership or sole proprietorship for federal income tax purposes) who owns more than ten percent (10%) of either
the capital interest or the profits interest in the Employer and who receives income for personal services from the Employer. 415
Compensation shall be based on the full Limitation Year regardless of when participation in the Plan commences. Furthermore, regardless
of any election made in the Adoption Agreement, 415 Compensation shall include any elective deferral (as defined in Code Â§Â§402(e)(3),
402(k) and 402(h)(1)(B)) and any amount which is contributed or deferred by the Employer at the election of the Participant and which is
not includible in the gross income of the Participant by reason of Code Â§Â§125, 457, and 132(f)(4). In addition, Military Differential Pay is
treated as 415 Compensation.
(a) Deemed 125 compensation. If elected in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective Dates and Other Permitted
Elections), 415 Compensation shall also include deemed Â§125 compensation. Deemed Â§125 compensation is an amount that is
excludable under Â§106 that is not available to a participant in cash in lieu of group health coverage under a Â§125 arrangement solely
because the participant is unable to certify that he or she has other health coverage. An amount will be treated as an amount under
Code Â§125 pursuant to the preceding sentence only if the Employer does not request or collect information regarding the Participant's
other health coverage as part of the enrollment process for the health plan.
(b) Post-severance compensation. The Administrator shall adjust 415 Compensation for amounts that would otherwise be included
in the definition of 415 Compensation but are paid by the later of 2 1/2 months after a Participant's severance from employment with
the Employer or the end of the Limitation Year that includes the date of the Participant's severance from employment with the
Employer, in accordance with the following, as elected in the Compensation Section of the Adoption Agreement. The preceding time
period, however, does not apply with respect to payments described in Subsections (4) and (5) below. Any other payment of
compensation paid after severance of employment that is not described in the following types of compensation is not considered 415
Compensation, even if payment is made within the time period specified above.

[PAGE 14]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(1) Regular pay. 415 Compensation shall include regular pay after severance of employment (to the extent otherwise included
in the definition of 415 Compensation) if:
(i) The payment is regular compensation for services during the Participant's regular working hours, or compensation for
services outside the Participant's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses, or
other similar payments; and
(ii) The payment would have been paid to the Participant prior to a severance from employment if the Participant had
continued in employment with the Employer.
(2) Leave cash-outs. 415 Compensation shall include leave cash-outs if those amounts would have been included in the
definition of 415 Compensation if they were paid prior to the Participant's severance from employment with the Employer, and
the amounts are for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation, or other leave, but only if the Participant would have been able to
use the leave if employment had continued.
(3) Deferred compensation. 415 Compensation shall include deferred compensation if those amounts would have been
included in the definition of 415 Compensation if they were paid prior to the Participant's severance from employment with the
Employer, and the amounts are received pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan, but only if the
payment would have been paid if the Participant had continued in employment with the Employer and only to the extent the
payment is includible in the Participant's gross income.
(4) Military Differential Pay. 415 Compensation shall include payments to an individual who does not currently perform
services for the Employer by reason of qualified military service (as that term is used in Code Â§414(u)(1)) to the extent those
payments do not exceed the amounts the individual would have received if the individual had continued to perform services for
the Employer rather than entering qualified military service.
(5) Disability pay. 415 Compensation shall include compensation paid to a Participant who is permanently and totally disabled,
as defined in Code Â§22(e)(3), provided, as elected by the Employer in the Compensation Section of the Adoption Agreement,
salary continuation applies to all Participants who are permanently and totally disabled for a fixed or determinable period, or the
Participant was not a Highly Compensated Employee immediately before becoming disabled.
(c) Administrative delay ("the first few weeks") rule. 415 Compensation for a Limitation Year shall generally not include
amounts earned but not paid during the Limitation Year solely because of the timing of pay periods and pay dates. However, if elected
in the Compensation Section of the Adoption Agreement, 415 Compensation for a Limitation Year shall include amounts earned but
not paid during the Limitation Year solely because of the timing of pay periods and pay dates, provided the amounts are paid during
the first few weeks of the next Limitation Year, the amounts are included on a uniform and consistent basis with respect to all
similarly situated Participants, and no Compensation is included in more than one Limitation Year.
(d) Back pay. Back pay, within the meaning of Regulations Â§1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as Compensation for the Limitation
Year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included
under this definition.
(e) Dollar limitation. 415 Compensation will be limited to the same dollar limitations set forth in Section 1.18(f) adjusted in such
manner as permitted under Code Â§415(d).
(f) Amendment. Except as otherwise provided herein, if, in connection with the adoption of any amendment, the definition of 415
Compensation has been modified, then for Plan Years prior to the Plan Year which includes the adoption date of such amendment,
415 Compensation means compensation determined pursuant to the terms of the Plan then in effect.
1.41 "Highly Compensated Employee" means an Employee described in Code Â§414(q) and the Regulations thereunder, and generally
means any Employee who:
(a) was a "five percent (5%) owner" as defined in Section 1.47(b) at any time during the "determination year" or the "look-back
year"; or
(b) for the "look-back year" had 415 Compensation from the Employer in excess of $80,000 and, if elected in the Adoption
Agreement, was in the Top-Paid Group for the "look-back year." The $80,000 amount is adjusted at the same time and in the same
manner as under Code Â§415(d). In applying this rule, the Employer may adopt any rounding or tie-breaking rules it desires, so long as
such rules are reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and uniformly and consistently applied.
The "determination year" means the Plan Year for which testing is being performed and the "look-back year" means the immediately
preceding twelve (12) month period. However, if the calendar year data election is made in the Adoption Agreement, for purposes of (b)
above, the "look-back year" shall be the calendar year beginning within the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the
"determination year."

A Highly Compensated Former Employee is based on the rules applicable to determining Highly Compensated Employee status as in
effect for that "determination year," in accordance with Regulation Â§1.414(q)-1T, A-4 and IRS Notice 97-45 (or any superseding guidance).
In determining who is a Highly Compensated Employee, Employees who are nonresident aliens and who received no earned income
(within the meaning of Code Â§911(d)) from the Employer constituting United States source income within the meaning of Code Â§861(a)(3)
shall not be treated as Employees. If a nonresident alien Employee has U.S. source income, that Employee is treated as satisfying this
definition if all of such Employee's U.S. source income from the Employer is exempt from U.S. income tax under an applicable income tax
treaty. Additionally, all Affiliated Employers shall be taken into account as a single Employer and Leased Employees within the meaning
of Code Â§Â§414(n)(2) and 414(o)(2) shall be considered Employees unless such Leased Employees are covered by a plan described in Code
Â§414(n)(5) and are not covered in any qualified plan maintained by the Employer. The exclusion of Leased Employees for this purpose
shall be applied on a uniform and consistent basis for all of the Employer's retirement plans. Highly Compensated Former Employees shall
be treated as Highly Compensated Employees without regard to whether they performed services during the "determination year."
1.42 "Highly Compensated Participant" means any Highly Compensated Employee who is eligible to participate in the component of
the Plan being tested.
1.43 "Hour of Service" means (a) each hour for which an Employee is directly or indirectly compensated or entitled to compensation by
the Employer for the performance of duties during the applicable computation period (these hours will be credited to the Employee for the
computation period in which the duties are performed); (b) each hour for which an Employee is directly or indirectly compensated or
entitled to Compensation by the Employer (irrespective of whether the employment relationship has terminated) for reasons other than
performance of duties (such as vacation, holidays, sickness, incapacity (including disability), jury duty, lay-off, military duty or leave of
absence) during the applicable computation period (these hours will be calculated and credited pursuant to Department of Labor regulation
Â§2530.200b-2 which is incorporated herein by reference); (c) each hour for which back pay is awarded or agreed to by the Employer
without regard to mitigation of damages (these hours will be credited to the Employee for the computation period or periods to which the
award or agreement pertains rather than the computation period in which the award, agreement or payment is made). The same Hours of
Service shall not be credited both under (a) or (b), as the case may be, and under (c).
Notwithstanding (b) above, (1) no more than 501 Hours of Service will be credited to an Employee on account of any single
continuous period during which the Employee performs no duties (whether or not such period occurs in a single computation period); (2)
an hour for which an Employee is directly or indirectly paid, or entitled to payment, on account of a period during which no duties are
performed is not required to be credited to the Employee if such payment is made or due under a plan maintained solely for the purpose of
complying with applicable workers' compensation, or unemployment compensation or disability insurance laws; and (3) Hours of Service
are not required to be credited for a payment which solely reimburses an Employee for medical or medically related expenses incurred by
the Employee. Furthermore, for purposes of (b) above, a payment shall be deemed to be made by or due from the Employer regardless of
whether such payment is made by or due from the Employer directly, or indirectly through, among others, a trust fund, or insurer, to which
the Employer contributes or pays premiums and regardless of whether contributions made or due to the trust fund, insurer, or other entity
are for the benefit of particular Employees or are on behalf of a group of Employees in the aggregate.
Hours of Service will be credited for employment with all Affiliated Employers and for any individual considered to be a Leased
Employee pursuant to Code Â§414(n) or 414(o) and the Regulations thereunder. Furthermore, the provisions of Department of Labor
Regulations Â§2530.200b-2(b) and (c) are incorporated herein by reference.
Hours of Service will be determined using the actual hours method unless one of the methods below is elected in the Adoption
Agreement. If the actual hours method is used to determine Hours of Service, an Employee is credited with the actual Hours of Service the
Employee completes with the Employer or the number of Hours of Service for which the Employee is paid (or entitled to payment).
If the days worked method is elected, an Employee will be credited with ten (10) Hours of Service if under the Plan such Employee
would be credited with at least one (1) Hour of Service during the day.
If the weeks worked method is elected, an Employee will be credited with forty-five (45) Hours of Service if under the Plan such

the Plan reduced by any outstanding loan balances pursuant to Section 7.4.
1.47 "Key Employee" means an Employee as defined in Code Â§416(i) and the Regulations thereunder. Generally, for purposes of
determining top-heavy status, any Employee or Former Employee (including any deceased Employee as well as each of the Employee's or

that contains the "determination date," has been included in one of the following categories:
(a) an officer of the Employer (as that term is defined within the meaning of the Regulations under Code Â§416) having annual 415

unincorporated business, any person who owns more than five percent (5%) of the capital or profits interest in the Employer; and

one percent (1%) of the capital or profits interest in the Employer.
In determining percentage ownership hereunder, employers that would otherwise be aggregated under Code Â§Â§414(b), (c), (m) and (o)
shall be treated as separate employers. In determining whether an individual has 415 Compensation of more than $150,000, 415
Compensation from each employer required to be aggregated under Code Â§Â§414(b), (c), (m) and (o) shall be taken into account.
1.48 "Late Retirement Date" means the date of, or the first day of the month or the Anniversary Date coinciding with or next following,

(unless otherwise elected in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective Dates and Other Permitted Elections)), and such
services are performed under primary direction or control by the recipient Employer. Contributions or benefits provided a Leased
Employee by the leasing organization which are attributable to services performed for the recipient Employer shall be treated as provided
by the recipient Employer. Furthermore, Compensation for a Leased Employee shall only include compensation from the leasing
organization that is attributable to services performed for the recipient Employer.
A Leased Employee shall not be considered an employee of the recipient Employer if: (a) such employee is covered by a money
purchase pension plan providing: (1) a non-integrated employer contribution rate of at least ten percent (10%) of compensation, as defined
in Code Â§415(c)(3), (2) immediate participation, and (3) full and immediate vesting; and (b) leased employees do not constitute more than
twenty percent (20%) of the recipient Employer's nonhighly compensated workforce.
1.50 "Limitation Year" means the "determination period" used to determine Compensation. However, the Employer may elect a different
Limitation Year in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective Dates and Other Permitted Elections). All qualified plans
maintained by the Employer must use the same Limitation Year. Furthermore, unless there is a change to a new Limitation Year, the
Limitation Year will be a twelve (12) consecutive month period. In the case of an initial Limitation Year, the Limitation Year will be the
twelve (12) consecutive month period ending on the last day of the period specified in the Adoption Agreement. If the Limitation Year is
amended to a different twelve (12) consecutive month period, the new "Limitation Year" must begin on a date within the "Limitation Year"
in which the amendment is made. The Limitation Year may only be changed by a Plan amendment. Furthermore, if the Plan is terminated
effective as of a date other than the last day of the Plan's Limitation Year, then the Plan is treated as if the Plan had been amended to
change its Limitation Year.
1.51 "Military Differential Pay" means any differential wage payments made to an individual that represents an amount which, when
added to the individual's military pay, approximates the amount of compensation that was paid to the individual while working for the

is treated as an Employee of the Employer making the payment.

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
The Plan is not treated as failing to meet the requirements of any provision described in Code Â§414(u)(1)(C) (or corresponding Plan
provisions, including, but not limited to, Plan provisions related to the ADP or ACP test) by reason of any contribution or benefit which is
based on the Military Differential Pay. The preceding sentence applies only if all Employees of the Employer performing service in the
uniformed services described in Code Â§3401(h)(2)(A) are entitled to receive differential wage payments (as defined in Code Â§3401(h)(2))
on reasonably equivalent terms and, if eligible to participate in a retirement plan maintained by the Employer, to make contributions based
on the payments on reasonably equivalent terms (taking into account Code Â§Â§410(b)(3), (4), and (5)).
1.52 "Nonelective Contribution" means the Employer's contributions to the Plan other than Elective Deferrals, any Qualified Nonelective
Contributions and any Qualified Matching Contributions.
1.53 "Nonhighly Compensated Employee/Participant" means any Employee/Participant who is not a Highly Compensated Employee.

Compensated Employee/Participant shall be determined using the definition of Highly Compensated Employee in effect for the preceding
Plan Year.
1.54 "Non-Key Employee" means any Employee or Former Employee (and such Employee's or Former Employee's Beneficiaries) who is
not a Key Employee.
1.55 "Normal Retirement Age" means the age elected in the Adoption Agreement at which time a Participant's Account shall be

enforces a mandatory retirement age, then the Normal Retirement Age is the lesser of that mandatory age or the age specified in the
Adoption Agreement.
1.56 "Normal Retirement Date" means the date elected in the Adoption Agreement.
1.57 "1-Year Break in Service" means, if the Hour of Service method is used, the applicable computation period that is used to determine
a Year of Service during which an Employee or Former Employee has not completed more than 500 Hours of Service. However, if the
Employer selected, in the Service Crediting Method Section of the Adoption Agreement, to define a Year of Service as less than 1,000
Hours of Service, then the 500 Hours of Service in this definition of 1-Year Break in Service shall be proportionately reduced. Further,
solely for the purpose of determining whether an Employee has incurred a 1-Year Break in Service, Hours of Service shall be recognized
for "authorized leaves of absence" and "maternity and paternity leaves of absence." For this purpose, Hours of Service shall be credited for
the computation period in which the absence from work begins, only if credit therefore is necessary to prevent the Employee from incurring
a 1-Year Break in Service, or, in any other case, in the immediately following computation period. The Hours of Service credited for a
"maternity or paternity leave of absence" shall be those which would normally have been credited but for such absence, or, in any case in
which the Administrator is unable to determine such hours normally credited, eight (8) Hours of Service per day. The total Hours of
Service required to be credited for a "maternity or paternity leave of absence" shall not exceed the number of Hours of Service needed to
prevent the Employee from incurring a 1-Year Break in Service.
"Authorized leave of absence" means an unpaid, temporary cessation from active employment with the Employer pursuant to an
established nondiscriminatory policy, whether occasioned by illness, military service, or any other reason.

of the Employee's child, placement of a child with the Employee in connection with the adoption of such child, or any absence for the
purpose of caring for such child for a period immediately following such birth or placement.
If the elapsed time method is elected in the Service Crediting Method Section of the Adoption Agreement, then a "1-Year Break in
Service" means a twelve (12) consecutive month period beginning on the severance from service date or any anniversary thereof and
ending on the next succeeding anniversary of such date; provided, however, that the Employee or Former Employee does not perform an
Hour of Service for the Employer during such twelve (12) consecutive month period.
1.58 "Participant" means any Employee or Former Employee who has satisfied the requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 and entered the
Plan and is eligible to accrue benefits under the Plan. In addition, the term "Participant" also includes any individual who was a Participant
(as defined in the preceding sentence) and who must continue to be taken into account under a particular provision of the Plan (e.g.,
because the individual has an Account balance in the Plan).
1.59 "Participant Directed Account" means that portion of a Participant's interest in the Plan with respect to which the Participant has
directed the investment in accordance with the Participant Direction Procedures.
1.60 "Participant Direction Procedures" means such instructions, guidelines or policies, the terms of which are incorporated herein, as

reemployment with the Employer or an Affiliated Employer and ending on the first day of a Period of Severance, or for benefit accrual
purposes, ending on the severance from service date. The first day of employment or reemployment is the first day the Employee performs
an Hour of Service. An Employee who incurs a Period of Severance of twelve (12) months or less will also receive service-spanning credit
by treating any such period as a Period of Service for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual). For purposes of benefit
accrual, a Participant's whole year Periods of Service is equal to the sum of all full and partial periods of service, whether or not such
service is continuous or contiguous, expressed in the number of whole years represented by such sum. For this purpose, fractional periods
of a year will be expressed in terms of days.
Periods of Service with any Affiliated Employer shall be recognized. Furthermore, Periods of Service with any predecessor employer
that maintained this Plan shall be recognized. Periods of Service with any other predecessor employer shall be recognized as elected in the
Adoption Agreement. However, for a standardized Adoption Agreement, the recognition of service with any other employer (1) is limited
to the period which does not exceed 5 years immediately preceding the year in which an amendment crediting such service becomes
effective, (2) must be credited to all Employees on a reasonably uniform basis, and (3) must otherwise comply with Regulation
Â§1.401(a)(4)-5(a)(3).
In determining Periods of Service for purposes of vesting under the Plan, Periods of Service will be excluded as elected in the
Adoption Agreement and as specified in Section 3.5.
In the event the method of crediting service is amended from the Hour of Service method to the elapsed time method, an Employee
will receive credit for a Period of Service consisting of:
(a) A number of years equal to the number of Years of Service credited to the Employee before the computation period during which
the amendment occurs; and
(b) The greater of (1) the Periods of Service that would be credited to the Employee under the elapsed time method for service during
the entire computation period in which the transfer occurs or (2) the service taken into account under the Hour of Service method as of
the date of the amendment.
In addition, the Employee will receive credit for service subsequent to the amendment commencing on the day after the last day of the
computation period in which the transfer occurs.
1.63 "Period of Severance" means a continuous period of time during which an Employee is not employed by the Employer. Such period
begins on the date the Employee retires, quits or is discharged, or if earlier, the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date on which the
Employee was otherwise first absent from service.
In the case of an individual who is absent from work for "maternity or paternity" reasons, the twelve (12) consecutive month period
beginning on the first anniversary of the first day of such absence shall not constitute a one year Period of Severance. For purposes of this
paragraph, an absence from work for "maternity or paternity" reasons means an absence (a) by reason of the pregnancy of the individual,
(b) by reason of the birth of a child of the individual, (c) by reason of the placement of a child with the individual in connection with the
adoption of such child by such individual, or (d) for purposes of caring for such child for a period beginning immediately following such
birth or placement.

must be equal to the benefit which can be provided with the percentage, as specified in the Adoption Agreement, of the Participant's Vested
interest in the Plan as of the date of death. If no election is made in the Adoption Agreement, the percentage shall be equal to fifty percent
(50%). Furthermore, if less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Participant's Vested interest in the Plan is used to provide the
Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity, a proportionate share of each of the Participant's Accounts subject to the Pre-Retirement Survivor
Annuity shall be used to provide the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity.

Roth Elective Deferrals will be maintained in a separate account containing only the Participant's Roth Elective Deferrals and gains and
losses attributable to those Roth Elective Deferrals. In addition, the Administrator shall, to the extent necessary for proper reporting,
separately account for any "in-Plan Roth rollover contributions" (as defined in Section 12.11) that are transferred to a Participant's Roth

Participant. A Salary Deferral Agreement may only apply to Compensation that becomes currently available to the Employee after the
effective date of the Salary Deferral Agreement.
1.75 "Self-Employed Individual" means an individual who has Earned Income for the taxable year from the trade or business for which

profits for the taxable year. A Self-Employed Individual shall be treated as an Employee.
1.76 "Short Plan Year" means, if specified in the Adoption Agreement or as the result of an amendment, a Plan Year of less than a
twelve (12) month period. If there is a Short Plan Year, the following rules shall apply in the administration of this Plan. In determining
whether an Employee has completed a Year of Service (or Period of Service if the elapsed time method is used) for benefit accrual
purposes in the Short Plan Year, the number of the Hours of Service (or months of service if the elapsed time method is used) required shall

In addition, if ninety percent (90%) or more of the Employees of the Employer are covered under agreements the Secretary of Labor
finds to be collective bargaining agreements between Employee representatives and the Employer, and the Plan covers only Employees
who are not covered under such agreements, then Employees covered by such agreements shall be excluded from both the total number of

The foregoing exclusions set forth in this Section shall be applied on a uniform and consistent basis for all purposes for which the
Code Â§414(q) definition is applicable. Furthermore, in applying such exclusions, the Employer may substitute any lesser service, hours or

performs an Hour of Service (employment commencement date). Unless otherwise elected in the Service Crediting Method Section of the
Adoption Agreement, the succeeding computation periods shall begin on the anniversary of the Employee's employment commencement
date. However, unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, if one (1) Year of Service or less is required as a condition of

anniversary of the date on which the Employee first performed an Hour of Service, and subsequent computation periods shall be the Plan
Year. If there is a shift to the Plan Year, an Employee who is credited with the number of Hours of Service to be credited with a Year of
Service in both the initial eligibility computation period and the first Plan Year which commences prior to the first anniversary of the
Employee's initial eligibility computation period will be credited with two (2) Years of Service for purposes of eligibility to participate.
If two (2) Years of Service are required as a condition of eligibility, a Participant will only have completed two (2) Years of Service
for eligibility purposes upon completing two (2) consecutive Years of Service without an intervening 1-Year Break in Service (referred to

elected in the Service Crediting Method Section of the Adoption Agreement. If no election is made in the Service Crediting Method
Section of the Adoption Agreement, then the computation period shall be the Plan Year.
In determining Years of Service for purposes of vesting under the Plan, Years of Service will be excluded as elected in the Adoption
Agreement and as specified in Section 3.5.
Years of Service and 1-Year Breaks in Service for eligibility purposes will be measured on the same eligibility computation period.
Years of Service and 1-Year Breaks in Service for vesting purposes will be measured on the same vesting computation period.
Years of Service with any Affiliated Employer shall be recognized. Furthermore, Years of Service with any predecessor employer that
maintained this Plan shall be recognized. Years of Service with any other employer shall be recognized as elected in the Adoption
Agreement. However, for a standardized Adoption Agreement, the recognition of service with any other employer (1) is limited to the
period which does not exceed 5 years immediately preceding the year in which an amendment crediting such service becomes effective, (2)
must be credited to all Employees on a reasonably uniform basis, and (3) must otherwise comply with Regulation Â§1.401(a)(4)-5(a)(3).
In the event the method of crediting service is amended from the elapsed time method to the Hour of Service method, an Employee
will receive credit for Years of Service equal to:
(a) The number of Years of Service equal to the number of 1-year Periods of Service credited to the Employee as of the date of the
amendment; and
(b) In the computation period which includes the date of the amendment, a number of Hours of Service (using the Hours of Service
equivalency method, if any, elected in the Adoption Agreement) to any fractional part of a year credited to the Employee under this
Section as of the date of the amendment.
ARTICLE II
ADMINISTRATION
2.1 POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE EMPLOYER
(a) Appointment of Trustee (or Insurer) and Administrator. In addition to the general powers and responsibilities otherwise
provided for in this Plan, the Employer shall be empowered to appoint and remove one or more Trustees (or Insurers) and
Administrators from time to time as it deems necessary for the proper administration of the Plan to ensure that the Plan is being
operated for the exclusive benefit of the Participants and their Beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the Plan, the Code, and
the Act. The Employer may appoint counsel, specialists, advisers, agents (including any nonfiduciary agent) and other persons as the
Employer deems necessary or desirable in connection with the exercise of its fiduciary duties under this Plan. The Employer may
compensate such agents or advisers from the assets of the Plan as fiduciary expenses (but not including any business (settlor) expenses
of the Employer), to the extent not paid by the Employer.
(b) Funding policy and method. The Employer shall establish a "funding policy and method," i.e., it shall determine whether the
Plan has a short run need for liquidity (e.g., to pay benefits) or whether liquidity is a long run goal and investment growth (and
stability of same) is a more current need, or shall appoint a qualified person to do so. If the Trustee (or Insurer) has discretionary
authority, the Employer or its delegate shall communicate such needs and goals to the Trustee (or Insurer), who shall coordinate such
Plan needs with its investment policy. The communication of such a "funding policy and method" shall not, however, constitute a
directive to the Trustee (or Insurer) as to the investment of the Trust Funds. Such "funding policy and method" shall be consistent with
the objectives of this Plan and with the requirements of Title I of the Act.
(c) Appointment of Investment Manager. Unless prohibited by the terms of the Trust agreement, the Employer may appoint, at its
option, one or more Investment Managers, investment advisers, or other agents to provide investment direction to the Trustee (or
Insurer) with respect to any or all of the Plan assets. Such appointment shall be given by the Employer in writing in a form acceptable
to the Trustee (or Insurer) and shall specifically identify the Plan assets with respect to which the Investment Manager or other agent
shall have the authority to direct the investment.

(d) Review of fiduciary performance. The Employer shall periodically review the performance of any Fiduciary or other person to
whom duties have been delegated or allocated by it under the provisions of this Plan or pursuant to procedures established hereunder.
This requirement may be satisfied by formal periodic review by the Employer or by a qualified person specifically designated by the
Employer, through day-to-day conduct and evaluation, or through other appropriate ways.
(e) Indemnity. To the extent permitted by the Code and the Act, and unless otherwise specified in a separate agreement, the
Employer will indemnify and hold harmless the Administrator, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, and agents of the
Employer; the Plan; the Trustees, Fiduciaries, Participants and Beneficiaries of the Plan, as well as their respective successors and
assigns, against any cause of action, loss, liability, damage, cost, or expense of any nature whatsoever (including, but not limited to,
attorney's fees and costs, whether or not suit is brought, as well as IRS plan disqualifications, other sanctions or compliance fees or
DOL fiduciary breach sanctions and penalties) arising out of or relating to the Employer's noncompliance with any of the Plan's terms
or requirements; any intentional or negligent act or omission the Employer commits with regard to the Plan; and any omission or
provision of incorrect information with regard to the Plan which causes the Plan to fail to satisfy the requirements of a tax-qualified
plan. This indemnity provision shall continue to apply to the Employer with respect to the period the entity was maintaining this Plan,
even if the Employer ceases to maintain the Plan.
2.2 DESIGNATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY
The Employer may appoint one or more Administrators. If the Employer does not appoint an Administrator, the Employer will be the
Administrator. Any person, including, but not limited to, the Employees of the Employer, shall be eligible to serve as an Administrator.
Any person so appointed shall signify acceptance by filing written or electronic acceptance with the Employer. An Administrator may
resign by delivering a written resignation to the Employer or be removed by the Employer by delivery of written notice of removal, to take
effect at a date specified therein, or upon delivery to the Administrator if no date is specified. Upon the resignation or removal of an
Administrator, the Employer may designate in writing a successor to this position.
2.3 ALLOCATION AND DELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES
If more than one person is appointed as Administrator, then the responsibilities of each Administrator may be specified by the
Employer and accepted in writing by each Administrator. If no such delegation is made by the Employer, then the Administrators may
allocate the responsibilities among themselves, in which event the Administrators shall notify the Employer and the Trustee (or Insurer) in
writing of such action and specify the responsibilities of each Administrator. The Trustee (or Insurer) thereafter shall accept and rely upon
any documents executed by the appropriate Administrator until such time as the Employer or the Administrators file with the Trustee (or
Insurer) a written revocation of such designation.
2.4 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE ADMINISTRATOR
The primary responsibility of the Administrator is to administer the Plan for the exclusive benefit of the Participants and their
Beneficiaries, subject to the specific terms of the Plan. The Administrator shall administer the Plan in accordance with its terms and shall
have the power and discretion to construe the terms of the Plan and determine all questions arising in connection with the administration,
interpretation, and application of the Plan. Benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Administrator decides in its discretion that the
applicant is entitled to them. Any such determination by the Administrator shall be conclusive and binding upon all persons. The
Administrator may establish procedures, correct any defect, supply any information, or reconcile any inconsistency in such manner and to
such extent as shall be deemed necessary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the Plan; provided, however, that any procedure,
discretionary act, interpretation or construction shall be done in a nondiscriminatory manner based upon uniform principles consistently
applied and shall be consistent with the intent that the Plan continue to be deemed a qualified plan under the terms of Code Â§401(a), and
shall comply with the terms of the Act and all regulations issued pursuant thereto. The Administrator shall have all powers necessary or
appropriate to accomplish its duties under this Plan.
The Administrator shall be charged with the duties of the general administration of the Plan and the powers necessary to carry out
such duties as set forth under the terms of the Plan, including, but not limited to, the following:
(a) the discretion to determine all questions relating to the eligibility of an Employee to participate or remain a Participant hereunder
and to receive benefits under the Plan;
(b) the authority to review and settle all claims against the Plan, including claims where the settlement amount cannot be calculated
or is not calculated in accordance with the Plan's benefit formula. This authority specifically permits the Administrator to settle
disputed claims for benefits and any other disputed claims made against the Plan;
(c) to compute, certify, and direct the Trustee (or Insurer) with respect to the amount and the kind of benefits to which any
Participant shall be entitled hereunder;
(d) to authorize and direct the Trustee (or Insurer) with respect to all discretionary or otherwise directed disbursements from the
Trust Fund;

desirable to be contributed to the Plan;
(i) to consult with the Employer and the Trustee (or Insurer) regarding the short and long-term liquidity needs of the Plan in order
that the Trustee (or Insurer) can exercise any investment discretion (if the Trustee (or Insurer) has such discretion), in a manner
designed to accomplish specific objectives;
(j) to prepare and implement a procedure for notifying Participants and Beneficiaries of their rights to elect Joint and Survivor
Annuities and Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuities if required by the Plan, Code and Regulations thereunder;
(k) to assist Participants regarding their rights, benefits, or elections available under the Plan;
(l) to act as the named Fiduciary responsible for communicating with Participants as needed to maintain Plan compliance with Act
Â§404(c) (if the Employer intends to comply with Act Â§404(c)) including, but not limited to, the receipt and transmission of
Participants' directions as to the investment of their Accounts under the Plan and the formation of policies, rules, and procedures
pursuant to which Participants may give investment instructions with respect to the investment of their Accounts; and
(m) to determine the validity of, and take appropriate action with respect to, any "qualified domestic relations order" received by it.
2.5 RECORDS AND REPORTS
The Administrator shall keep a record of all actions taken and shall keep all other books of account, records, and other data that may
be necessary for proper administration of the Plan and shall be responsible for supplying all information and reports to the Internal Revenue
Service, Department of Labor, Participants, Beneficiaries and others as required by law.
2.6 APPOINTMENT OF ADVISERS
The Administrator may appoint counsel, specialists, advisers, agents (including nonfiduciary agents) and other persons as the
Administrator deems necessary or desirable in connection with the administration of this Plan, including but not limited to agents and
advisers to assist with the administration and management of the Plan, and thereby to provide, among such other duties as the
Administrator may appoint, assistance with maintaining Plan records and the providing of investment information to the Plan's investment
fiduciaries and, if applicable, to Plan Participants.
2.7 INFORMATION FROM EMPLOYER
The Employer shall supply full and timely information to the Administrator on all pertinent facts as the Administrator may require in
order to perform its functions hereunder and the Administrator shall advise the Trustee (or Insurer) of such of the foregoing facts as may be
pertinent to the Trustee's (or Insurer's) duties with respect to the Plan. The Administrator may rely upon such information as is supplied by
the Employer and shall have no duty or responsibility to verify such information.
2.8 PAYMENT OF EXPENSES
All reasonable expenses of administration may be paid out of the Plan assets unless paid by the Employer. Such expenses shall include
any expenses incident to the functioning of the Administrator, or any person or persons retained or appointed by any named Fiduciary
incident to the exercise of their duties under the Plan, including, but not limited to, fees of accountants, counsel, Investment Managers,
agents (including nonfiduciary agents) appointed for the purpose of assisting the Administrator or Trustee (or Insurer) in carrying out the
instructions of Participants as to the directed investment of their Accounts (if permitted) and other specialists and their agents, the costs of
any bonds required pursuant to Act Â§412, and other costs of administering the Plan. If liquid assets of the Plan are insufficient to cover the
fees of the Trustee (or Insurer) or the Administrator, then Plan assets shall be liquidated to the extent necessary for such fees. In the event
any part of the Plan assets becomes subject to tax, all taxes incurred will be paid from the Plan assets. Until paid, the expenses shall
constitute a liability of the Trust Fund.
Expenses may be charged to Account. Unless specifically prohibited under statute, regulation or other guidance of general applicability,
the Administrator may charge to the Account of an individual Participant a reasonable charge to offset the cost of making a distribution to
the Participant, Beneficiary, or Alternate Payee.

2.9 MAJORITY ACTIONS
Except where there has been an allocation and delegation of administrative authority pursuant to Section 2.3, if there is more than one
Administrator, then they shall act by a majority of their number but may authorize one or more of them to sign all papers on their behalf.
2.10 CLAIMS PROCEDURES
(a) Initial claim. Claims for benefits under the Plan may be filed in writing with the Administrator. Written or electronic notice of
the disposition of a claim shall be furnished to the claimant within ninety (90) days (45 days if the claim involves disability benefits
and disability is not based on the Social Security Acts) after the application is filed, or such period as is required by applicable law or
Department of Labor regulation. Any electronic notification shall comply with the standards imposed by Department of Labor
Regulation Â§2520.104b-1(c)(1)(i), (iii) and (iv) or any subsequent guidance. In the event the claim is denied, the reasons for the denial
shall be specifically set forth in the notice in language calculated to be understood by the claimant, pertinent provisions of the Plan
shall be cited, and, where appropriate, an explanation as to how the claimant can perfect the claim will be provided. In addition, the
claimant shall be furnished with an explanation of the Plan's claims review procedure.
(b) Claims review. Any Employee, Former Employee, or Beneficiary of either, who has been denied a benefit by a decision of the
Administrator pursuant to Section 2.10 shall be entitled to request the Administrator to give further consideration to the claim by filing
with the Administrator a written request. Such request, together with a written statement of the reasons why the claimant believes such
claim should be allowed, shall be filed with the Administrator no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of the written notification
provided for in Section 2.10(a). A final decision as to the allowance of the claim shall be made by the Administrator within sixty (60)
days (45 days if the claim involves disability benefits and disability is not based on the Social Security Acts) of receipt of the appeal
(unless there has been an extension of sixty (60) days (45 days if the claim involves disability benefits and disability is not based on
the Social Security Acts) due to special circumstances, provided the delay and the special circumstances occasioning it are
communicated to the claimant within the sixty (60) day period (45 days if the claim involves disability benefits and disability is not
based on the Social Security Acts)). Such communication shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and
shall include specific reasons for the decision and specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.
The communication may be written or electronic (provided the electronic communication complies with the standards imposed by
Department of Labor Regulation Â§2520.104b-1(c)(1)(i), (iii) and (iv) or any subsequent guidance). Notwithstanding the preceding, to
the extent any of the time periods specified in this Section are amended by law or Department of Labor regulation, then the time
frames specified herein shall automatically be changed in accordance with such law or regulation.
(c) Deadline to file claim. To be considered timely under the Plan's claims procedures, a claim must be filed under Sections 2.10(a)
or (b) above within one year after the claimant knew or reasonably should have known of the principal facts upon which the claim is
based. Knowledge of all facts that the Participant knew or reasonably should have known shall be imputed to the claimant for the
purpose of applying this deadline.
(d) Exhaustion of administrative remedies. The exhaustion of the claims procedures is mandatory for resolving every claim and
dispute arising under this Plan. As to such claims and disputes: (1) no claimant shall be permitted to commence any legal action to
recover Plan benefits or to enforce or clarify rights under the Plan, under Act Â§502 or Â§510 or under any other provision of law,
whether or not statutory, until the claims procedures set forth in Subsections (a) and (b) above have been exhausted in their entirety;
and (2) in any such legal action all explicit and all implicit determinations by the Administrator (including, but not limited to,
determinations as to whether the claim, or a request for a review of a denied claim, was timely filed) shall be afforded the maximum
deference permitted by law.
(e) Deadline to file action. No legal action to recover Plan benefits or to enforce or clarify rights under the Plan, under Act Â§502 or
Â§510 or under any other provision of law, whether or not statutory, may be brought by any claimant on any matter pertaining to this
Plan unless the legal action is commenced in the proper forum before the earlier of: (1) thirty (30) months after the claimant knew or
reasonably should have known of the principal facts on which the claim is based, or (2) six (6) months after the claimant has
exhausted the claims procedure under this Plan. Knowledge of all facts that the Participant knew or reasonably should have known
shall be imputed to every claimant who is or claims to be a Beneficiary of the Participant or otherwise claims to derive an entitlement
by reference to the Participant for purposes of applying the previously specified periods.
(f) Plan Administrator discretion; court review. The Administrator and all persons determining or reviewing claims have full
discretion to determine benefit claims under the Plan. Any interpretation, determination or other action of such persons shall be
subject to review only if it is arbitrary or capricious or otherwise an abuse of discretion. Any review of a final decision or action of the
persons reviewing a claim shall be based only on such evidence presented to or considered by such persons at the time they made the
decision that is the subject of review.
(g) Overriding procedures. The Administrator may adopt other claims procedures that override all or a portion of the provisions set
forth in this Plan Section 2.10 provided such provisions or procedures are consistent with the requirements of ERISA.

ARTICLE III
ELIGIBILITY
3.1 CONDITIONS OF ELIGIBILITY
An Eligible Employee shall be eligible to participate hereunder on the date such Employee has satisfied the conditions of eligibility, if
any, elected in the Adoption Agreement. The Administrator may, on a uniform and consistent basis, apply Plan provisions relating to
months based on a 30-day month.
3.2 EFFECTIVE DATE OF PARTICIPATION
(a) General rule. An Eligible Employee who has satisfied the conditions of eligibility pursuant to Section 3.1 shall become a
Participant effective as of the date elected in the Adoption Agreement. Regardless of any election in the Adoption Agreement to the
contrary, an Eligible Employee who has satisfied the maximum age (21) and service requirements (one (1) Year (or Period) of Service
(or, with respect to contributions other than Elective Deferrals, more than one (1) year if full and immediate vesting)) and who is
otherwise entitled to participate, will become a Participant no later than the earlier of (1) six (6) months after such requirements are
satisfied, or (2) the first day of the first Plan Year after such requirements are satisfied, unless the Employee separates from service
before such participation date.
(b) Rehired Employee. If an Eligible Employee is not employed on the date determined pursuant to (a) above, but is reemployed
before a 1-Year Break in Service has occurred, then such Eligible Employee shall become a Participant on the date of reemployment
or, if later, the date that the Employee would have otherwise entered the Plan had the Employee not terminated employment. If such
Employee incurs a 1-Year Break in Service, then eligibility will be determined under the 1-Year Break in Service rules set forth in
Section 3.5.
(c) Recognition of predecessor service. Unless specifically provided otherwise in the Adoption Agreement, an Eligible Employee
who satisfies the Plan's eligibility requirement conditions by reason of recognition of service with a predecessor employer will become
a Participant as of the day the Plan credits service with a predecessor employer or, if later, the date the Employee would have
otherwise entered the Plan had the service with the predecessor employer been service with the Employer.
(d) Noneligible to eligible class. If an Employee, who has satisfied the Plan's eligibility requirements and would otherwise have
become a Participant, shall go from a classification of a noneligible Employee to an Eligible Employee, such Employee shall become
a Participant on the date such Employee becomes an Eligible Employee or, if later, the date that the Employee would have otherwise
entered the Plan had the Employee always been an Eligible Employee.
(e) Eligible to noneligible class. If an Employee, who has satisfied the Plan's eligibility requirements and would otherwise become a
Participant, shall go from a classification of an Eligible Employee to a noneligible class of Employees, such Employee shall become a
Participant in the Plan on the date such Employee again becomes an Eligible Employee, or, if later, the date that the Employee would
have otherwise entered the Plan had the Employee always been an Eligible Employee. However, if such Employee incurs a 1-Year
Break in Service, eligibility will be determined under the 1-Year Break in Service rules set forth in Section 3.5.
(f) Matching contributions. With respect to the determination of any matching contributions, the Plan will disregard Elective
Deferrals made while a Participant is not eligible for the matching contribution component of the Plan unless otherwise elected in the
Adoption Agreement.
3.3 DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY
The Administrator shall determine the eligibility of each Employee for participation in the Plan based upon information furnished by
the Employer. Such determination shall be conclusive and binding upon all persons, as long as the same is made pursuant to the Plan and
the Act. Such determination shall be subject to review pursuant to Section 2.10(b).
3.4 TERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY
In the event a Participant shall go from a classification of an Eligible Employee to an ineligible Employee, such Participant shall
continue to vest in the Plan for each Year of Service (or Period of Service, if the elapsed time method is used) completed while an
ineligible Employee, until such time as the Participant's Account is forfeited or distributed pursuant to the terms of the Plan. Additionally,
the Participant's interest in the Plan shall continue to share in the earnings of the Trust Fund in the same manner as Participants.
3.5 REHIRED EMPLOYEES AND 1-YEAR BREAKS IN SERVICE
(a) Rehired Participant/immediate re-entry. If any Former Employee who had been a Participant is reemployed by the Employer,
then the Employee shall become a Participant as of the reemployment date, unless the Employee is not an Eligible Employee or unless
the Employee does not satisfy the eligibility conditions taking into account prior service to the extent such prior service is not

[PAGE 26]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
disregarded pursuant to Section 3.5(d) or (e) below. If such prior service is disregarded, then the rehired Eligible Employee shall be
treated as a new hire.
(b) Rehired Eligible Employee who satisfied eligibility. If any Eligible Employee had satisfied the Plan's eligibility requirements
but, due to a severance of employment, did not become a Participant, then such Eligible Employee shall become a Participant as of the
later of (1) the entry date on which he or she would have entered the Plan had there been no severance of employment, or (2) the date
of his or her re-employment. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the rehired Eligible Employee's prior service is disregarded pursuant to
Section 3.5(d) or (e) below, then the rehired Eligible Employee shall be treated as a new hire.
(c) Rehired Eligible Employee who had not satisfied eligibility. If any Eligible Employee who had not satisfied the Plan's
eligibility requirements is rehired after severance from employment, then such Eligible Employee shall become a Participant in the
Plan in accordance with the eligibility requirements set forth in the Adoption Agreement and the Plan. However, in applying any shift
in an eligibility computation period, the Eligible Employee is not treated as a new hire unless prior service is disregarded in
accordance with Section 3.5(d) or (e) below.
(d) Reemployed after five (5) 1-Year Breaks in Service ("rule of parity" provisions). If any Employee is reemployed after five
(5) 1-Year Breaks in Service has occurred, Years of Service (or Periods of Service if the elapsed time method is being used) shall
include Years of Service (or Periods of Service if the elapsed time method is being used) prior to the five (5) 1-Year Breaks in Service
subject to the rules set forth below. The Employer may elect in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective Dates and
Other Permitted Elections) to make the provisions of this paragraph inapplicable for purposes of eligibility and/or vesting.
(1) In the case of a Former Employee who under the Plan does not have a nonforfeitable right to any interest in the Plan
resulting from Employer contributions, Years of Service (or Periods of Service) before a period of 1-Year Breaks in Service will
not be taken into account if the number of consecutive 1-Year Breaks in Service equals or exceeds the greater of (i) five (5) or (ii)
the aggregate number of pre-break Years of Service (or Periods of Service). Such aggregate number of Years of Service (or
Periods of Service) will not include any Years of Service (or Periods of Service) disregarded under the preceding sentence by
reason of prior 1-Year Breaks in Service;
(2) A Former Employee who has not had Years of Service (or Periods of Service) before a 1-Year Break in Service disregarded
pursuant to (1) above, shall participate in the Plan as of the date of reemployment, or if later, as of the date the Former Employee
would otherwise enter the Plan pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.2 taking into account all service not disregarded.
(e) One-Year Hold-Out Rule. If elected in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective Dates and Other Permitted
Elections), the "one-year hold-out" rule under Code Â§410(a)(5)(C) applies. Under this rule, a Participant who has severed employment
will incur a suspension of participation in the Plan after incurring a 1-Year Break in Service and the Plan disregards a Participant's
service completed prior to a 1-Year Break in Service until the Participant completes one Year of Service following the 1-Year Break
in Service. The Plan suspends the Participant's participation in the Plan as of the first day of the eligibility computation period
following the eligibility computation period in which the Participant incurs the 1-Year Break in Service.
(1) Completion of one Year of Service. If a Participant completes one Year of Service following a 1-Year Break in Service,
the Plan restores the Participant's pre-break service retroactively to the first day of the eligibility computation period in which the
Participant first completes one Year of Service following the 1-Year Break in Service.
(2) Eligibility computation period. The Administrator measures the initial eligibility computation period under this Subsection
from the date the Participant first receives credit for an Hour of Service following the 1-Year Break in Service. The
Administrator measures any subsequent eligibility computation periods, if necessary, in a manner consistent with the eligibility
computation periods, using the re-employment commencement date in determining the anniversary of the date of hire, if
applicable.
(3) Application to Employee who did not enter. The Administrator also will apply the one-year hold-out rule, if applicable, to
an Employee who satisfies the Plan's eligibility conditions, but who incurs a separation from service and a 1-Year Break in
Service prior to becoming a Participant.
(4) No restoration under two (2) 1-Year Breaks in Service rule. The Administrator in applying this Subsection does not
restore any service disregarded under the two (2) 1-Year Breaks in Service rule in Section 1.88.
(5) No application to Elective Deferrals. The Administrator will not apply the provisions of this Subsection with respect to
eligibility to make Elective Deferrals under the Plan.
(6) USERRA. An Employee who has completed qualified military service and who the Employer has rehired under the
Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended (USERRA), does not incur a 1-Year Break
in Service under the Plan by reason of the period of such qualified military service.

[PAGE 27]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(f) Vesting after five (5) 1-Year Breaks in Service. If a Participant incurs five (5) consecutive 1-Year Breaks in Service, the
Vested portion of such Participant's Account attributable to pre-break service shall not be increased as a result of post-break service. In
such case, separate accounts will be maintained as follows:
(1) one account for nonforfeitable benefits attributable to pre-break service; and
(2) one account representing the Participant's Employer-derived Account balance in the Plan attributable to post-break service.
(g) Buyback provisions. If any Former Employee who had been a Participant is reemployed by the Employer before five (5)
consecutive 1-Year Breaks in Service, and such Participant had received a distribution of the entire Vested interest prior to
reemployment, then the forfeited account shall be reinstated only if the Participant repays the full amount which had been distributed
(including amounts from Accounts that were fully Vested such as the Elective Deferral Account). The Employer, may, however, on a
uniform and nondiscriminatory basis, only require the Participant to repay amounts that relate to the Account that was not fully
Vested. Such repayment must be made before the earlier of five (5) years after the first date on which the Participant is subsequently
reemployed by the Employer or the close of the first period of five (5) consecutive 1-Year Breaks in Service commencing after the
distribution. If a distribution occurs for any reason other than a severance of employment, the time for repayment may not end earlier
than five (5) years after the date of distribution. If the Participant repays the distribution with after-tax amounts, such amounts are not
after-tax voluntary Employee contributions subject to the ACP Test set forth in Section 12.6.
In the event the Participant repays the full amount distributed, the undistributed forfeited portion of the Participant's Account
must be restored in full, unadjusted by any gains or losses occurring subsequent to the Valuation Date preceding the distribution. The
source for such reinstatement may be Forfeitures occurring during the Plan Year. If such source is insufficient, then the Employer will
contribute an amount which is sufficient to restore the Participant's Account, provided, however, that if a discretionary contribution is
made for such year, such contribution will first be applied to restore any such accounts and the remainder shall be allocated in
accordance with the terms of the Plan. If a non-Vested Participant was deemed to have received a distribution and such Participant is
reemployed by the Employer before five (5) consecutive 1-Year Breaks in Service, then such Participant will be deemed to have
repaid the deemed distribution as of the date of reemployment.
(h) Waiver of allocation or contribution conditions. If the Employer elects in the Adoption Agreement to waive allocations or
contributions due to retirement (early or normal retirement), then a Participant shall only be entitled to one such waiver. Accordingly,
if a Participant retires and allocation or contribution conditions are waived, then the Plan will not waive the allocation or contribution
conditions if the Participant is rehired and then retires again.
3.6 ELECTION NOT TO PARTICIPATE
(a) Standardized plans. If the Employer has adopted a standardized Adoption Agreement, then an Employee is not permitted to
elect not to participate in the Plan.
(b) Non-standardized plans. If the Employer has adopted a non-standardized Adoption Agreement, then an Employee may, subject
to the approval of the Employer, elect voluntarily not to participate in any component of the Plan before the Employee first becomes
eligible to participate in any qualified plan (subject to Code Â§401(a)) maintained by the Employer. Such election must be made upon
inception of the Plan or any other plan or arrangement of the Employer that is described in Code Â§219(g)(5)(A) (whether or not
terminated) or at any time prior to the time the Employee first becomes eligible to participate under any such plan maintained by the
Employer. The election not to participate must be irrevocable and communicated to the Employer, in writing, within a reasonable
period of time before the date the Employee would have otherwise entered the Plan. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the
contrary, if any prior Plan document of this Plan contained a provision permitting an Employee to make a revocable election not to
participate and an Employee made such revocable election not to participate while that prior Plan document was in effect, then such
Employee's waiver shall continue to be in effect.
(c) Effect of election. An Employee who elects, or had previously elected, not to participate under the Plan is treated as a
nonbenefiting Employee for purposes of the minimum coverage requirements under Code Â§410(b) and, if such election applies to
Elective Deferrals, the Employee is not an eligible Participant for purposes of the ADP test set forth in Section 12.4 or the ACP test set
forth in Section 12.6.
3.7 OMISSION OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE; INCLUSION OF INELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE
If, in any Plan Year, any Employee who should be included as a Participant in the Plan is erroneously omitted and discovery of such
omission is not made until after a contribution by the Employer for the year has been made and allocated, or any person who should not
have been included as a Participant in the Plan is erroneously included, then the Employer may take corrective actions consistent with, the
IRS Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (i.e., Rev. Proc. 2018-52, Rev. Proc. 2019-19, or any subsequent guidance).

CONTRIBUTION AND ALLOCATION

[PAGE 28]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
4.1 FORMULA FOR DETERMINING EMPLOYER'S CONTRIBUTION
(a) For a Money Purchase Plan:
(1) The Employer will make contributions on the following basis. On behalf of each Participant eligible to share in allocations,
for each year of such Participant's participation in this Plan, the Employer will contribute the amount elected in the Adoption
Agreement. All contributions by the Employer will be made in cash. In the event a funding waiver is obtained, this Plan shall be
deemed to be an individually designed plan.
(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to an Employer which is not a tax-exempt entity, the Employer's contribution
for any Fiscal Year shall not exceed the maximum amount allowable as a deduction to the Employer under the provisions of
Code Â§404. However, to the extent necessary to provide the top-heavy minimum allocations, the Employer shall make a
contribution even if it exceeds the amount that is deductible under Code Â§404.
(b) For a Profit Sharing Plan:
(1) For each Plan Year, the Employer may (or will in the case of a "prevailing wage contribution" as set forth in the Profit
Sharing Formula Section of the Adoption Agreement) contribute to the Plan such amount as elected by the Employer in the
Adoption Agreement. In addition, the Employer may make a discretionary "gateway contribution" pursuant to Section 4.3(b)(4).
(2) Additionally, the Employer will contribute to the Plan the amount necessary, if any, to provide the top-heavy minimum
allocations even if it exceeds current or accumulated net profit or the amount that is deductible under Code Â§404.
(3) Subject to the consent of the Trustee (or Insurer), the Employer may make its contribution to the Plan in the form of
unencumbered property instead of cash, provided the contribution of property is not a prohibited transaction. The decision to
make a contribution of property is subject to the general fiduciary rules under the Act.
(c) Frozen Plans. The Employer may designate that the Plan is a frozen Plan at the Contribution Types Section of the Adoption
Agreement. As a frozen Plan, the Employer will not make any Employer contributions with respect to Compensation earned after the
date the Plan is frozen, and if the Plan is a 401(k) Plan, no Participant will be permitted to make Elective Deferrals to the Plan for any
period following such date. In addition, once a Plan is frozen, no additional Employees shall become Participants.
(d) Union Employees. Regardless of any provision in this Plan to the contrary, Employees whose employment is governed by a
collective bargaining agreement between the Employer and "employee representatives" under which retirement benefits were the
subject of good faith bargaining shall be eligible to participate in this Plan to the extent of employment covered by such agreement
provided the agreement provides for coverage in the Plan. The benefits, including but not limited to, contributions, allocations and
vesting, under this Plan shall be those set forth in the Adoption Agreement. For this purpose, the term "employee representatives" does
not include any organization more than half of whose members are employees who are owners, officers, or executives of the
Employer. The provisions of this Subsection only apply if no more than two percent (2%) of the Employees covered pursuant to the
agreement are professionals as defined in Regulation Â§1.410(b)-9. If a Participant performs services both as a collectively bargained
Employee and as a non-collectively bargained Employee, then the Participant's Hours of Service and Compensation in each respective
category are treated separately for purposes of the Plan.
4.2 TIME OF PAYMENT OF EMPLOYER'S CONTRIBUTION
Unless otherwise provided by contract or law, the Employer may make its contribution to the Plan for a particular Plan Year at such
time as the Employer, in its sole discretion, determines. However, the Employer shall pay its contribution for each Plan Year not later than
the time prescribed by law for filing the Employer's Federal income tax return for the fiscal (or taxable) year with or within which such
Plan Year ends (including extensions thereof). If, pursuant to Section 12.8, the "ADP test safe harbor contribution" being made to the Plan
(including a contribution being made pursuant to a QACA as described in Section 12.9) is a matching contribution that is made on a basis
other than the Plan Year, then the matching contributions must be contributed to the Plan by the last day of the Plan Year quarter
immediately following the Plan Year quarter to which the contributions relate. If the Employer makes a contribution for a particular Plan
Year after the close of that Plan Year, the Employer will designate to the Administrator the Plan Year for which the Employer is making its
contribution.
Participant Contribution remittance: Elective Contribution and after-tax voluntary Employee contribution remittances must be deposited
with the Trust as soon as administratively feasible as of the earliest date by which such contributions can reasonably be segregated from the
employer's general assets. Assets to be remitted to the Trust by the Employer under this section include amounts (other than union dues)
that a Participant or Beneficiary pays to an Employer or amounts that a Participant has withheld from his or her wages by an Employer for
contribution to the Plan.
For Employers with less than 100 Participants at the beginning of the Plan Year, any amount remitted to the Trust must not occur later
than:

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
ï· The 7th business day following the day on which such amount is received by the Employer (in the case of amounts that a
Participant or Beneficiary pays to an Employer), or
ï· The 7th business day following the day on which such amount would otherwise have been payable to the Participant in cash (in
the case of amounts withheld by an Employer from a Participant's wages)
4.3 ALLOCATION OF CONTRIBUTIONS, FORFEITURES AND EARNINGS
(a) Separate accounting. The Administrator shall establish and maintain an Account in the name of each Participant to which the
Administrator shall credit as of each Anniversary Date, or other Valuation Date, all amounts allocated to each such Participant as set
forth herein.
(b) Allocation of contributions. The Employer shall provide the Administrator with all information required by the Administrator to
make a proper allocation of the Employer's contribution, if any, for each Plan Year. Within a reasonable period of time after the date
of receipt by the Administrator of such information, the Administrator shall allocate any contributions as follows:
(1) Money Purchase allocation. For a Money Purchase Plan (other than a Money Purchase Plan which is integrated by
allocation):
(i) The Employer's contribution shall be allocated to each Participant's Account in the manner set forth in Section 4.1
herein and as specified in the Adoption Agreement.
(ii) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions, a Participant shall only be eligible to share in the allocations of the
Employer's contribution for the year if the Participant is an Eligible Employee at any time during the year and the conditions
set forth in the Adoption Agreement and Section 3.5(h) are satisfied, unless a top-heavy contribution is required pursuant to
Section 4.3(f). If no election is made in the Adoption Agreement, then a Participant shall be eligible to share in the
allocation of the Employer's contribution for the year if the Participant completes more than five hundred (500) Hours of
Service (or three (3) consecutive calendar months if the elapsed time method is chosen in the Adoption Agreement) during
the Plan Year or is employed on the last day of the Plan Year. Furthermore, with respect to a non-standardized Adoption
Agreement, regardless of any election in the Adoption Agreement to the contrary, for the Plan Year in which this Plan
terminates, a Participant shall only be eligible to share in the allocation of the Employer's contributions for the Plan Year if
the Participant is employed at the end of the Plan Year and has completed a Year of Service (or Period of Service if the
elapsed time method is elected).
(2) Permitted disparity allocation. For an integrated Profit Sharing Plan or 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan allocation or a Money
Purchase Plan which is integrated by allocation:
(i) Subject to the "overall permitted disparity limits," the Employer's contribution shall be allocated to each Participant's
Account in a dollar amount equal to 5.7% of the sum of each Participant's Compensation plus Excess Compensation. If the
Employer does not contribute such amount for all Participants, each Participant will be allocated a share of the contribution
in the same proportion that each such Participant's Compensation plus Excess Compensation for the Plan Year bears to the
total Compensation plus the total Excess Compensation of all Participants for that year. However, in the case of any
Participant who has exceeded the "cumulative permitted disparity limit," the allocation set forth in this paragraph shall be
based on such Participant's Compensation rather than Compensation plus Excess Compensation.
Regardless of the preceding, 4.3% shall be substituted for 5.7% above if Excess Compensation is based on more than
20% and less than or equal to 80% of the Taxable Wage Base. If Excess Compensation is based on less than 100% and more
than 80% of the Taxable Wage Base, then 5.4% shall be substituted for 5.7% above.
(ii) The balance of the Employer's contribution over the amount allocated above, if any, shall be allocated to each
Participant's Account in the same proportion that each such Participant's Compensation for the Plan Year bears to the total
Compensation of all Participants for such year.
(iii) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions, a Participant shall only be eligible to share in the allocations of the
Employer's contribution for the year if the Participant is an Eligible Employee at any time during the year and the conditions
set forth in the Adoption Agreement and Section 3.5(h) are satisfied, unless a top-heavy contribution is required pursuant to
Section 4.3(f). If no election is made in the Adoption Agreement, then a Participant shall be eligible to share in the
allocation of the Employer's contribution for the year if the Participant completes more than five hundred (500) Hours of
Service (or three (3) consecutive calendar months if the elapsed time method is chosen in the Adoption Agreement) during
the Plan Year or is employed on the last day of the Plan Year.

(iv) The following "overall permitted disparity limits" (which consist of the "annual overall permitted disparity limit" and
the "cumulative permitted disparity limit") apply to the allocations set forth above.
(A) "Annual overall permitted disparity limit." Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, if in any Plan Year this
Plan "benefits" any Participant who "benefits" under another qualified plan or simplified employee pension, as defined
in Code Â§408(k), maintained by the Employer that either provides for or imputes permitted disparity (integrates), then
such plans will be considered to be one plan and will be considered to comply with the permitted disparity rules if the
extent of the permitted disparity of all such plans does not exceed 100%. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the
extent of the permitted disparity of a plan is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, which the actual benefits, benefit rate,
offset rate, or employer contribution rate, whatever is applicable under the Plan, bears to the limitation under Code
Â§401(l) applicable to such Plan.
(B) "Cumulative permitted disparity limit." With respect to a Participant who "benefits" or "has benefited" under a
defined benefit or target benefit plan of the Employer, the "cumulative permitted disparity limit" for the Participant is
thirty-five (35) total cumulative permitted disparity years. Total cumulative permitted disparity years means the number
of years credited to the Participant for allocation or accrual purposes under the Plan, any other qualified plan or
simplified employee pension plan (whether or not terminated) ever maintained by the Employer, while such plan either
provides for or imputes permitted disparity. For purposes of determining the Participant's "cumulative permitted
disparity limit," all years ending in the same calendar year are treated as the same year. If the Participant has not
"benefited" under a defined benefit or target benefit plan which neither provides for nor imputes permitted disparity for
any year beginning on or after January 1, 1994, then such Participant has no cumulative disparity limit.
For purposes of this Section, "benefiting" means benefiting under the Plan for any Plan Year during which a Participant
received or is deemed to receive an allocation in accordance with Regulation Â§1.410(b)-3(a).
(3) Other profit sharing allocations. For a Profit Sharing Plan or 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan with a non-integrated allocation
formula, a uniform points allocation formula, a "prevailing wage contribution" allocation formula, an "age-weighted method"
allocation formula, or a "grouping method" allocation formula as elected in the Employer Profit Sharing Contribution Section of
the Adoption Agreement:
(i) The Employer's contribution shall be allocated to each Participant's Account in accordance with the allocation method
below that corresponds to the elections in the Adoption Agreement. The Employer shall provide the Administrator with all
information required by the Administrator to make a proper allocation of the Employer's contribution for each Plan Year.
Within a reasonable period of time after the date of receipt by the Administrator of such information, the allocation shall be
made in accordance with the provisions below.
(ii) If the Employer's contribution is fixed, the Employer shall allocate the contribution in a set percentage to each
Participant. If the Employer elects to contribute a uniform dollar amount for each Participant, the pro rata allocation shall
allocate that uniform dollar amount to each Participant.
(iii) If the Employer's contribution is discretionary and non-integrated, the contribution shall be allocated either in the same
ratio as each Participant's Compensation bears to the total of such Compensation of all Participants, in the same dollar
amount to all Participants (per capita), or in the same dollar amount per Hour of Service completed by each Participant.
(iv) If the Employer's Contribution is allocated under a uniform points allocation formula, the allocation for each
Participant shall be determined based on the Participant's total points for the Plan Year, as determined under the Adoption
Agreement. A Participant's allocation of the Employer Contribution is determined by multiplying the Employer Contribution
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Participant's total points for the Plan Year and the denominator of which is the
sum of the points for all Participants for the Plan Year. A Participant shall receive points for each year(s) of age and/or each
Year(s) of Service. In addition, a Participant also may receive points based on his or her Compensation.
(v) If the Employer's contribution is a "prevailing wage contribution", it shall be allocated to each Participant who
performs services subject to the Service Contract Act, Davis-Bacon Act or similar federal, state, or municipal prevailing
wage statutes. The "prevailing wage contribution" will be an amount equal to the balance of the prevailing wage defined
bona fide fringe benefit amount based on the Participant's employment classification as designated on the prevailing wage
determination appropriate for that classification. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the "prevailing wage
contribution" shall be fully Vested. Furthermore, the "prevailing wage contribution" shall not be subject to any age, service
or employment condition requirements set forth in the Adoption Agreement and the Employer shall make such contribution
to the Plan as frequently as is required under applicable law.
(vi) If the Employer's contribution is allocated according to a "grouping method," the Employer may contribute to the Plan
on behalf of each of the classifications of Participants set forth in the Adoption Agreement such amount as shall be
determined by the Employer. The Employer shall provide the Administrator, if other than the Employer, with written
notification of the amount of the contribution to be allocated to each classification on or before the due date of the
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers
25

[PAGE 31]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
Employer's tax return for the year of allocation, through written instructions from the Employer to the Administrator. The
Employer may elect to specify any number of classifications and a classification may consist of any number of Participants.
(vii) If the Employer's contribution is allocated according to an "age-weighting method," the Employer's contribution for the
Plan Year shall be allocated to each Participant's Account in the same proportion that each such Participant's total points
with respect to such year, bear to the total points awarded to all Participants with respect to such year. The conditional
allocation provided for in the preceding sentence shall become the final allocation for the year only if it is not a Top-Heavy
Plan Year; or if the minimum allocation required for Top-Heavy Plan Years is provided to all Employees eligible to receive
such minimum allocation. If any such Employee does not receive the top-heavy minimum allocation, then in lieu of the
conditional allocation, the Employer's contribution shall instead be allocated first to the affected Employees in an amount
equal to their conditional allocation plus any additional amount necessary to provide the top-heavy minimum allocation.
The remainder of the Employer's contribution shall then be allocated as provided under the conditional allocation
method, but for this purpose, those Employees who did not receive the top-heavy minimum allocation under the initial
conditional allocation shall not be considered. If under the secondary allocation provided in the preceding sentence, an
Employee who received a top-heavy minimum contribution under the conditional allocation no longer receives the same,
then the steps outlined in the preceding paragraph and sentence shall be repeated until such time as all affected Employees
have been allocated the top-heavy minimum contribution and the remaining contribution has been allocated, at which time,
the allocations for the year shall be final.
A Participant's points with respect to any Plan Year shall be computed as follows:
(A) Multiply the Participant's Compensation for the Plan Year by 1%.
(B) Multiply the product for each Participant as determined in (a) above by the product of:
1. the factor in Table I in Exhibit A to the Adoption Agreement, such factor to be determined by reference to the
Participant's Normal Retirement Age, and
2. the factor in Table II of Exhibit A to the Adoption Agreement, such factor to be determined by reference to
the number of years remaining from the Participant's attained age as of the allocation date to his or her Normal
Retirement Age.
The schedule of Age-Weighted Allocation Factors is set forth in Exhibit A to the Adoption Agreement,
(which is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of the Plan) and shall be based on the interest rate
selected in the Adoption Agreement (if no selection is made, 8.5% interest shall be deemed to have been elected).
3. The resulting number shall be the number of points allocated to the Participant.
(viii) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions, a Participant shall only be eligible to share in the allocations of the
Employer's contribution for the year if the Participant is an Eligible Employee at any time during the year and the conditions
set forth in the Adoption Agreement and Section 3.5(h) are satisfied, unless a top-heavy contribution is required pursuant to
Section 4.3(f). If no election is made in the Adoption Agreement, then a Participant shall be eligible to share in the
allocation of the Employer's contribution for the year if the Participant completes more than five hundred (500) Hours of
Service (or three (3) consecutive calendar months if the elapsed time method is chosen in the Adoption Agreement) during
the Plan Year or is employed on the last day of the Plan Year.
(4) Gateway contribution. In addition to any other Nonelective Contribution, for any Plan Year that the Employer is treating
Nonelective Contributions to this Plan as if such Contributions were benefit accruals under a defined benefit plan for purposes of
satisfying the nondiscrimination requirements of IRC Section 401(a)(4) and the regulations thereunder (i.e., conducting a âcrossâ
test), the Employer shall also contribute the minimum amount of Gateway Contribution. In applying the provisions of this
Subsection (4), the term "Employer contributions" shall also include any Forfeitures that are allocated to a Participant, other than
Forfeitures that are subject to Code Â§401(m) because they are allocated as a matching contribution. Furthermore, in applying the
provisions of this Subsection (4) to a 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, the term "Employer contributions" means any Employer
Nonelective Contributions, nonelective "ADP test safe harbor contributions," and, except as otherwise provided in Subsections
(4)(ii) and (iv) below, Qualified Nonelective Contributions, and such term excludes any matching contributions.
(i) Any "gateway contribution" made pursuant to this Subsection for a Plan Year will be allocated to each Nonhighly
Compensated Participant who receives an allocation of other "Employer contributions," for such Plan Year. In applying the
provisions of this subsection, the term "Employer contributions" means any Nonelective Contributions (including any
amount that is contributed solely for the purpose of meeting any top heavy contribution requirement), any ADP Safe Harbor
Nonelective Contributions and, except as otherwise provided in subsections (ii) and (iv) below, any Qualified Nonelective
Contributions, but such term excludes any Matching Contributions. Furthermore, the term "Employer contributions" shall
also include any Forfeitures that are allocated to a Participant, other than Forfeitures that are subject to Code Â§401(m)
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers
26

[PAGE 32]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
because those Forfeitures are allocated as Matching Contributions. The "gateway contribution" will be allocated without
regard to any allocation conditions otherwise applicable to "Employer contributions" under the Plan. However, Participants
who the Administrator disaggregates pursuant to Regulation Â§1.410(b)-7(c)(3) because they have not satisfied the greatest
minimum age and service conditions permissible under Code Â§410(a) shall not be eligible to receive an allocation of any
"gateway contribution" made pursuant to this Subsection unless such an allocation is necessary to satisfy Code Â§401(a)(4).
(ii) The "gateway contribution" will be allocated pro rata on the basis of Compensation (as defined in (iii) or (iv) below,
whichever is applicable) of each eligible Participant (as described in Subsection (i) above) but in no event will an allocation
of the "gateway contribution" exceed the lesser of: (A) five percent (5%) of Compensation or (B) one-third (1/3) of the
highest allocation rate for any Highly Compensated Participant for the Plan Year. Any allocation under the prior sentence
will be reduced by the amount of any other "Employer contributions," excluding any Qualified Nonelective Contributions
that are used to satisfy the ADP test set forth in Section 12.4 or the ACP test set forth in Section 12.6, allocated for the same
Plan Year to such Participant, provided that if an eligible Participant is receiving only a Qualified Nonelective Contribution
and such contribution amount equals or exceeds the "gateway contribution," then the contribution satisfies the "gateway
contribution" requirement as to that Participant.
(iii) For allocation purposes under the 5% "gateway contribution" under (A) of Subsection (ii) above, Compensation means
415 Compensation except that it may be determined for the Plan Year (rather than the Limitation Year) and shall exclude
415 Compensation paid while an Employee is not a Participant in the Plan.
(iv) For purposes of the 1/3 "gateway contribution" alternative under (B) of Subsection (ii) above, the Administrator will
(A) determine the allocation rate, and (B) allocate the "gateway contribution," using a Participant's Compensation, provided
the definition of Compensation satisfies Regulation Â§1.414(s). In addition, the allocation rate for any Participant is
determined by dividing the total "Employer contribution" made on behalf of such Participant by the Participant's
Compensation (as defined in the preceding sentence). However, solely for purposes of determining the allocation rate of any
Nonhighly Compensated Participant, Qualified Nonelective Contributions that are used to satisfy the ADP test set forth in
Section 12.4 or the ACP test set forth in Section 12.6, shall not be taken into account.
(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Employer may increase the "gateway contribution" to satisfy the provisions of
Regulation Â§1.401(a)(4)-9(b)(2)(v)(D) if the plan (for nondiscrimination testing purposes) consists of one or more defined
contribution plans and one or more defined benefit plans.
(c) Gains or losses. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.10 with respect to Participant Directed Accounts, as of each
Valuation Date, before allocation of any Employer contributions and Forfeitures, any earnings or losses (net appreciation or net
depreciation) of the Trust Fund (exclusive of assets segregated for distribution) shall be allocated in accordance with such rules and
procedures that are established by the Administrator and that are applied in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner based upon the
investments of the Trust Fund and the Participants' accounts to which the net income is allocated. For purposes of this Section, the
term "net income" means the net of any interest, dividends, unrealized appreciation and depreciation, capital gains and losses, and
investment expenses of the Trust Fund determined on each Valuation Date. However, Participants' accounts which have been
segregated for investment purposes (including any Participant Directed Accounts) will only have the net income earned thereon
allocated thereto. Policy dividends or credits will be allocated to the Participant's Account for whose benefit the Policy is held.
ERISA recapture account. The Administrator in its discretion may use an "ERISA Recapture Account" to pay non-settlor Plan
expenses and may allocate funds in the "ERISA Recapture Account" (or excess funds therein after payment of Plan expenses) as
earnings or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. The Administrator will exercise its discretion in a reasonable, uniform and
nondiscriminatory manner. An "ERISA Recapture Account" is an account designated to receive amounts which a Plan service
provider receives in the form of 12b-1 fees, sub-transfer agency fees, shareholder servicing fees or similar amounts (also known as
"revenue sharing"), which are received by the service provider from a source other than the Plan and which the service provider may
remit to the Plan.
Late trading and market timing settlement. In the event the Plan becomes entitled to a settlement from a mutual fund or other
investment relating to late trading, market timing or other activities, the Administrator will allocate the settlement proceeds to
Participants and Beneficiaries in accordance with Department of Labor Field Assistance Bulletin 2006-01 or other applicable law.
(d) Contracts. Participants' Accounts shall be debited for any insurance or annuity premiums paid, if any, and credited with any
dividends or interest received on Contracts.
(e) Forfeitures. Forfeitures must be disposed of no later than the last day of the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the
Forfeiture occurs. The Employer may direct the Administrator to use Forfeitures to reinstate previously forfeited Account balances of
Participants, if any, in accordance with Section 3.5(g), to satisfy any contribution that may be required pursuant to Section 6.10, or, to
pay any Plan expenses. With respect to a Money Purchase Plan, any remaining Forfeitures will be disposed of in accordance with the
elections in the Adoption Agreement. With respect to all other plans, the Employer must direct the Administrator to use any remaining
Forfeitures in accordance with any combination of the following methods, including a different method based on the source of such
Forfeitures. Forfeitures may be:
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers
27

[PAGE 33]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(1) Added to any Employer discretionary contribution (e.g., matching or profit sharing) and allocated in the same manner;
(2) Used to reduce any Employer contribution (e.g., matching or profit sharing);
(3) Added to any Employer matching contribution and allocated as an additional matching contribution; or
(4) Allocated to all Participants in the same proportion that each Participant's Compensation for the Plan Year bears to the
Compensation of all Participants for such year.
If Forfeitures are allocated to Participants (rather than used to reduce Employer contributions) then the Employer must also direct
the Administrator as to which Participants are eligible to share in such allocation. The maximum allocation conditions the Employer
may require are that Participants complete one (1) Year of Service (or Period of Service) and be employed on the last day of the Plan
Year in order to share in the allocation of Forfeitures for such Plan Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Employer has adopted
a standardized Adoption Agreement, then the maximum allocation conditions are that Participants complete more than five hundred
(500) Hours of Service (or three (3) consecutive calendar months if the elapsed time method is chosen in the Adoption Agreement)
during the Plan Year or be employed on the last day of the Plan Year.
(f) Minimum allocations required for Top-Heavy Plan Years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any Top-Heavy Plan Year, the
sum of the Employer's contributions and Forfeitures allocated to the Participant's Combined Account of each Non-Key Employee or
each Participant, if elected in the Adoption Agreement, shall be equal to at least three percent (3%) of such Employee's 415
Compensation for the Plan Year or the calendar year ending within the Plan Year (reduced by contributions and Forfeitures, if any,
allocated to each such Employee in any defined contribution plan included with this Plan in a "required aggregation group" (as defined
in Section 9.2(f)). However, if (1) the sum of the Employer's contributions and Forfeitures allocated to the Participant's Combined
Account of each Key Employee for such Top-Heavy Plan Year is less than three percent (3%) of each Key Employee's 415
Compensation and (2) this Plan is not required to be included in a "required aggregation group" (as defined in Section 9.2(f)) to enable
a defined benefit plan to meet the requirements of Code Â§401(a)(4) or 410, the sum of the Employer's contributions and Forfeitures
allocated to the Participant's Combined Account of each Employee entitled to the top-heavy minimum contribution shall be equal to
the largest percentage allocated to the Participant's Combined Account of any Key Employee. The minimum allocation required (to
the extent required to be nonforfeitable under Code Â§416(b)) may not be forfeited under Code Â§411(a)(3)(B) or 411(a)(3)(D).
However, for each Employee who is a Participant in a Profit Sharing Plan or 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and a Money Purchase
Plan, the minimum three percent (3%) allocation specified above shall be provided in the Money Purchase Plan unless otherwise
elected in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective Dates and Other Permitted Elections).
(g) Top-heavy contribution allocation. For purposes of the minimum allocations set forth above, the percentage allocated to the
Participant's Combined Account of any Key Employee shall be equal to the ratio of the sum of the Employer's contributions and
Forfeitures allocated on behalf of such Key Employee divided by the 415 Compensation for such Key Employee.
(h) Participants eligible for top-heavy allocation. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, for any Top-Heavy Plan
Year, the minimum allocations set forth in this Section shall only be allocated to the Participant's Combined Account of all Non-Key
Employees, and Key Employees if elected in the Adoption Agreement, who are Participants and who are employed by the Employer
on the last day of the Plan Year (unless otherwise elected in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective Dates and
Other Permitted Elections)), including Employees who have (1) failed to complete a Year of Service; (2) declined to make mandatory
contributions (if required) or, in the case of a cash or deferred arrangement, Elective Deferrals to the Plan; or (3) Compensation less
than a stated amount. In addition, pursuant to Code Â§416(i)(4), Participants whose employment is governed by a collective bargaining
agreement between the Employer and employee representatives under which retirement benefits were the subject of good faith
bargaining shall not be eligible to receive the top-heavy minimum allocations unless otherwise provided in the collective bargaining
agreement.
(i) Top-heavy allocation if DB and DC plans maintained. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in any Plan Year in
which the Employer maintains both this Plan and a non-frozen defined benefit pension plan included in a "required aggregation group"
(as defined in Section 9.2(f)) which is top-heavy, the Employer will not be required (unless otherwise elected in Appendix A to the
Adoption Agreement (Special Effective Dates and Other Permitted Elections)) to provide Employees with both the full separate
minimum defined benefit plan benefit and the full separate defined contribution plan top-heavy minimum allocations. In such case, the
top-heavy minimum benefits will be provided as elected in the Adoption Agreement and, if applicable, as follows:
(1) If the 5% defined contribution minimum is elected in the Adoption Agreement:
(i) The requirements of Section 9.1 will apply except that each Employee who is entitled to the Top-Heavy minimum
benefit in the Profit Sharing Plan or Money Purchase Plan and who accrues a benefit in the Defined Benefit Plan will
receive a minimum allocation of five percent (5%) of such Participant's 415 Compensation from the "applicable defined
contribution plan(s)."

[PAGE 34]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(ii) For each Employee who is a participant only in the Defined Benefit Plan, the Employer will provide a minimum
non-integrated benefit equal to two percent (2%) of such participant's highest five (5) consecutive year average 415
Compensation for each Year of Service while a participant in such plan, in which the Plan is top-heavy, not to exceed
ten (10) such years.
(iii) For each Employee who is a Participant only in this defined contribution plan, the Employer will provide a minimum
allocation equal to three percent (3%) of such Participant's 415 Compensation.
(2) If the 2% defined benefit minimum is elected in the Adoption Agreement, then for each Employee who is entitled to the
Top-Heavy minimum benefit only in the defined benefit plan, the Employer will provide a minimum non-integrated benefit equal
to two percent (2%) of such participant's highest five (5) consecutive year average of 415 Compensation for each Year of Service
while a participant in the plan, in which the plan is top-heavy, not to exceed ten (10) such years.
(j) Matching contributions used to satisfy top-heavy contribution. Unless otherwise specified in Appendix A to the Adoption
Agreement (Special Effective Dates and Other Permitted Elections), Employer matching contributions shall be taken into account for
purposes of satisfying the minimum contribution requirements of Code Â§416(c)(2) and the Plan. The preceding sentence shall apply
with respect to matching contributions under the Plan or, if the Plan provides that the minimum contribution requirement shall be met
in another plan, such other plan. Employer matching contributions that are used to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements
shall be treated as matching contributions for purposes of the ACP test and other requirements of Code Â§401(m).
(k) Contributions under other plans. The Employer may provide, in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective
Dates and Other Permitted Elections), that the minimum benefit requirement shall be met in another plan (including another plan that
consists solely of a cash or deferred arrangement which meets the requirements of Code Â§401(k)(12) and matching contributions with
respect to which the requirements of Code Â§401(m)(11) apply). The Employer must specify the name of the other plan, the minimum
benefit that will be provided under such other plan, and the Employees who will receive the minimum benefit under such other plan.
(l) Delay in processing transactions. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, all information necessary to properly
reflect a given transaction may not be available until after the date specified herein for processing such transaction, in which case the
transaction will be reflected when such information is received and processed. Subject to express limits that may be imposed under the
Code, the processing of any contribution, distribution or other transaction may be delayed for any legitimate business reason
(including, but not limited to, failure of systems or computer programs, failure of the means of the transmission of data, force majeure,
the failure of a service provider to timely receive values or prices, and correction for errors or omissions or the errors or omissions of
any service provider). The processing date of a transaction will be binding for all purposes of the Plan.
(m) 410(b) ratio percentage fail-safe provisions. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, the provisions of this
Subsection apply for any Plan Year if, in the non-standardized Adoption Agreement, the Employer elected to apply the 410(b) ratio
percentage fail-safe provisions and the Plan fails to satisfy the "ratio percentage test" due to a last day of the Plan Year allocation
condition or an Hours of Service (or months of service) allocation condition. A plan satisfies the "ratio percentage test" if, on the last
day of the Plan Year, the "benefiting ratio" of the Nonhighly Compensated Employees who are "includible" is at least 70% of the
"benefiting ratio" of the Highly Compensated Employees who are "includible." The "benefiting ratio" of the Nonhighly Compensated
Employees is the number of "includible" Nonhighly Compensated Employees "benefiting" under the Plan divided by the number of
"includible" Employees who are Nonhighly Compensated Employees. The "benefiting ratio" of the Highly Compensated Employees
is the number of Highly Compensated Employees "benefiting" under the Plan divided by the number of "includible" Highly
Compensated Employees. "Includible" Employees are all Employees other than: (1) those Employees excluded from participating in
the Plan for the entire Plan Year by reason of the collective bargaining unit exclusion or the nonresident alien exclusion described in
the Code or by reason of the age and service requirements of Article III; and (2) any Employee who incurs a separation from service
during the Plan Year and fails to complete at least 501 Hours of Service (or three (3) months of service if the elapsed time method is
being used) during such Plan Year.
For purposes of this Subsection, an Employee is "benefiting" under the Plan on a particular date if, under the Plan, the Employee
is entitled to an Employer contribution or an allocation of Forfeitures for the Plan Year.
If this Subsection applies and the Hours of Service method is used, then the Administrator will suspend the allocation conditions
and expand the group of the "includible" Nonhighly Compensated Employees who are Participants by including the minimum number
of Participants eligible to share in the contribution, beginning first with the "includible" Employees employed by the Employer on the
last day of the Plan Year who have completed the greatest number of Hours of Service in the Plan Year, then the "includible"
Employees who have completed the greatest number of Hours of Service during the Plan Year, and continuing to suspend the
allocation conditions for each "includible" Employee who completed Hours of Service, from the greatest number of Hours of Service
to the least, until the Plan satisfies the "ratio percentage test" for the Plan Year. If two or more "includible" Employees have the same
number of Hours of Service, then the Administrator will suspend the allocation conditions for all such "includible" Employees,
irrespective of whether the Plan can satisfy the "ratio percentage test" by accruing benefits for fewer than all such "includible"
Employees. If the Plan for any Plan Year suspends the allocation conditions for an "includible" Employee, then that Employee will
share in the allocation for that Plan Year of the Employer contribution and Forfeitures, if any, without regard to whether the Employee
has satisfied the other allocation conditions set forth in this Section.

If this Subsection applies and the elapsed time method is used, then the Administrator will suspend the allocation conditions for
the "includible" Nonhighly Compensated Employees who are Participants, beginning first with the "includible" Employees employed
by the Employer on the last day of the Plan Year, then the "includible" Employees who have the latest separation from service during
the Plan Year, and continuing to suspend the allocation conditions for each "includible" Employee who incurred an earlier separation
from service, from the latest to the earliest separation from service date, until the Plan satisfies the "ratio percentage test" for the Plan
Year. If two or more "includible" Employees have a separation from service on the same day, then the Administrator will suspend the
allocation conditions for all such "includible" Employees, irrespective of whether the Plan can satisfy the "ratio percentage test" by
accruing benefits for fewer than all such "includible" Employees. If the Plan for any Plan Year suspends the allocation conditions for
an "includible" Employee, then that Employee will share in the allocation for that Plan Year of the Employer contribution and
Forfeitures, if any, without regard to whether the Employee has satisfied the other allocation conditions set forth in this Section.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the portion of the Plan which is not a Code Â§401(k) or 401(m) plan would fail to satisfy Code
Â§410(b) if the coverage tests were applied by treating those Participants whose only allocation would otherwise be provided under the
top-heavy formula as if they were not currently benefiting under the Plan, then, for purposes of applying this Subsection (m), such
Participants shall be treated as not benefiting.
4.4 MAXIMUM ANNUAL ADDITIONS
(a) Calculation of "annual additions."
(1) If a Participant does not participate in, and has never participated in another qualified plan maintained by the "employer," or
a welfare benefit fund (as defined in Code Â§419(e)) maintained by the "employer," or an individual medical benefit
account (as defined in Code Â§415(l)(2)) maintained by the "employer," or a simplified employee pension (as defined in
Code Â§408(k)) maintained by the "employer" which provides "annual additions," the amount of "annual additions"
which may be credited to the Participant's Accounts for any Limitation Year shall not exceed the lesser of the
"maximum permissible amount" or any other limitation contained in this Plan. If the "employer" contribution that
would otherwise be contributed or allocated to the Participant's Accounts would cause the "annual additions" for the
Limitation Year to exceed the "maximum permissible amount," the amount contributed or allocated will be reduced so
that the "annual additions" for the Limitation Year will equal the "maximum permissible amount," and any amount in
excess of the "maximum permissible amount" which would have been allocated to such Participant may be allocated to
other Participants.
(2) Prior to determining the Participant's actual 415 Compensation for the Limitation Year, the "employer" may determine the
"maximum permissible amount" for a Participant on the basis of a reasonable estimation of the Participant's 415
Compensation for the Limitation Year, uniformly determined for all Participants similarly situated.
(3) As soon as is administratively feasible after the end of the Limitation Year, the Administrator shall determine the "maximum
permissible amount" for each Participant for such Limitation Year on the basis of the Participant's actual 415
Compensation for such Limitation Year.
(b) "Annual additions" if a Participant is in more than one plan.
(1) Except as provided in Subsection (c) below, this Subsection applies if, in addition to this Plan, a Participant is covered under
another "employer" maintained qualified defined contribution plan, welfare benefit fund (as defined in Code Â§419(e)), individual
medical benefit account (as defined in Code Â§415(l)(2)), or simplified employee pension (as defined in Code Â§408(k)), which
provides "annual additions," during any Limitation Year. The "annual additions" which may be credited to a Participant's
Accounts under this Plan for any such Limitation Year shall not exceed the "maximum permissible amount" reduced by the
"annual additions" credited to a Participant's accounts under the other plans and welfare benefit funds, individual medical benefit
accounts, and simplified employee pensions for the same Limitation Year. If the "annual additions" with respect to the Participant
under other defined contribution plans and welfare benefit funds maintained by the "employer" are less than the "maximum
permissible amount" and the "employer" contribution that would otherwise be contributed or allocated to the Participant's
accounts under this Plan would cause the "annual additions" for the Limitation Year to exceed this limitation, the amount
contributed or allocated will be reduced so that the "annual additions" under all such plans and welfare benefit funds for the
Limitation Year will equal the "maximum permissible amount," and any amount in excess of the "maximum permissible amount"
which would have been allocated to such Participant may be allocated to other Participants. If the "annual additions" with respect
to the Participant under such other defined contribution plans, welfare benefit funds, individual medical benefit accounts and
simplified employee pensions in the aggregate are equal to or greater than the "maximum permissible amount," no amount will
be contributed or allocated to the Participant's Account under this Plan for the Limitation Year.
(2) Prior to determining the Participant's actual 415 Compensation for the Limitation Year, the "employer" may determine the
"maximum permissible amount" for a Participant on the basis of a reasonable estimation of the Participant's 415 Compensation
for the Limitation Year, uniformly determined for all Participants similarly situated.

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(3) As soon as is administratively feasible after the end of the Limitation Year, the "maximum permissible amount" for the
Limitation Year will be determined on the basis of the Participant's actual 415 Compensation for the Limitation Year.
(4) If, pursuant to Section 4.4(b)(2), a Participant's "annual additions" under this Plan and such other plans would result in an
"excess amount" for a Limitation Year, the "excess amount" will be deemed to consist of the "annual additions" last allocated,
except that "annual additions" attributable to a simplified employee pension will be deemed to have been allocated first, followed
by "annual additions" to a welfare benefit fund or individual medical benefit account, and then by "annual additions" to a plan
subject to Code Â§412, regardless of the actual allocation date.
(5) If an "excess amount" was allocated to a Participant on an allocation date of this Plan which coincides with an allocation
date of another plan, the "excess amount" attributed to this Plan will be the product of:
(i) the total "excess amount" allocated as of such date, times
(ii) the ratio of (A) the "annual additions" allocated to the Participant for the Limitation Year as of such date under this
Plan to (B) the total "annual additions" allocated to the Participant for the Limitation Year as of such date under this and all
the other qualified defined contribution plans.
(c) Coverage under another plan. If the Participant is covered under another qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the
"employer," "annual additions" which may be credited to the Participant's Accounts under this Plan for any Limitation Year will be
limited in accordance with Section 4.4(b), unless the "employer" provides other limitations in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement
(Special Effective Dates and Other Permitted Elections).
(d) Time when "annual additions" credited. An "annual addition" is credited to the Account of a Participant for a particular
Limitation Year if it as allocated to the Participant's Account under the Plan as of any date within that Limitation Year. However, an
amount is not deemed allocated as of any date within a Limitation Year if such allocation is dependent upon participation in the Plan
as of any date subsequent to such date.
For purposes of this subparagraph, "employer" contributions are not deemed credited to a Participant's Account for a particular
Limitation Year unless the contributions are actually made to the Plan no later than thirty (30) days after the end of the period
described in Code Â§404(a)(6) applicable to the taxable year with or within which the particular Limitation Year ends. In the case of an
Employer that is exempt from federal income tax (including a governmental employer), Employer contributions are treated as credited
to a Participant's Account for a particular Limitation Year only if the contributions are actually made to the Plan no later than the 15th
day of the tenth calendar month following the end of the calendar year or Fiscal Year (as applicable, depending on the basis on which
the Employer keeps its books) with or within which the particular Limitation Year ends.
(e) Definitions. For purposes of this Section, the following terms shall be defined as follows:
(1) "Annual additions" means the sum credited to a Participant's accounts for any Limitation Year of (a) "employer"
contributions, (b) Employee contributions (except as provided below), (c) Forfeitures, (d) amounts allocated to an individual
medical benefit account, as defined in Code Â§415(l)(2), which is part of a pension or annuity plan maintained by the "employer,"
(e) amounts derived from contributions paid or accrued which are attributable to post-retirement medical benefits allocated to the
separate account of a key employee (as defined in Code Â§419A(d)(3)) under a welfare benefit fund (as defined in Code Â§419(e))
maintained by the "employer" and (f) allocations under a simplified employee pension. Except, however, the Compensation
percentage limitation referred to in paragraph (e)(6)(ii) below shall not apply to: (1) any contribution for medical benefits (within
the meaning of Code Â§419A(f)(2)) after separation from service which is otherwise treated as an "annual addition," or (2) any
amount otherwise treated as an "annual addition" under Code Â§415(l)(1).
(i) Restorative payments. "Annual additions" for purposes of Code Â§415 and this Section shall not include restorative
payments. A restorative payment is a payment made to restore losses to a Plan resulting from actions by a Fiduciary for
which there is reasonable risk of liability for breach of a fiduciary duty under the Act or under other applicable federal or
state law, where Participants who are similarly situated are treated similarly with respect to the payments. Generally,
payments are restorative payments only if the payments are made in order to restore some or all of the Plan's losses due to an
action (or a failure to act) that creates a reasonable risk of liability for such a breach of fiduciary duty (other than a breach of
fiduciary duty arising from failure to remit contributions to the Plan). This includes payments to a plan made pursuant to a
Department of Labor order, the Department of Labor's Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program, or a court-approved
settlement, to restore losses to a qualified defined contribution plan on account of the breach of fiduciary duty (other than a
breach of fiduciary duty arising from failure to remit contributions to the Plan). Payments made to the Plan to make up for
losses due merely to market fluctuations and other payments that are not made on account of a reasonable risk of liability for
breach of a fiduciary duty under the Act are not restorative payments and generally constitute contributions that are
considered "annual additions."
(ii) Other amounts. "Annual additions" for purposes of Code Â§415 and this Section shall not include: (A) The direct
transfer of a benefit or employee contributions from a qualified plan to this Plan; (B) Rollover contributions (as described in
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers
31

[PAGE 37]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
Code Â§Â§401(a)(31), 402(c)(1), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3), and 457(e)(16)); (C) Repayments of loans made to a
Participant from the Plan; and (D) Repayments of amounts described in Code Â§411(a)(7)(B) (in accordance with
Code Â§411(a)(7)(C)) and Code Â§411(a)(3)(D) or repayment of contributions to a governmental plan (as defined in
Code Â§414(d)) as described in Code Â§415(k)(3), as well as Employer restorations of benefits that are required pursuant to
such repayments.
(2) "Defined contribution dollar limitation" means $56,000 (or the amount as adjusted under Code Â§415(d)).
(3) "Employer" means, for purposes of this Section, the Employer that adopts this Plan and all Affiliated Employers, except
that for purposes of this Section, the determination of whether an entity is an Affiliated Employer shall be made by applying
Code Â§415(h).
(4) "Excess amount" means the excess of the Participant's "annual additions" for the Limitation Year over the "maximum
permissible amount."
(5) "Maximum permissible amount" means, except to the extent permitted under this Plan and Code Â§414(v), the maximum
"annual addition" that may be contributed or allocated to a Participant's Accounts under the Plan for any Limitation Year, which
shall not exceed the lesser of:
(i) the "defined contribution dollar limitation," or
(ii) one hundred percent (100%) of the Participant's 415 Compensation for the Limitation Year.
The 415 Compensation Limitation referred to in (ii) shall not apply to any contribution for medical benefits after
separation from service (within the meaning of Code Â§Â§401(h) or 419A(f)(2)) which is otherwise treated as an "annual
addition."
If a short Limitation Year is created because of an amendment changing the Limitation Year to a different twelve (12)
consecutive month period, the "maximum permissible amount" will not exceed the "defined contribution dollar limitation"
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short Limitation Year and the denominator
of which is twelve (12).
(f) Special rules.
(1) Aggregation of plans. For purposes of applying the limitations of Code Â§415, all defined contribution plans (without regard
to whether a plan has been terminated) ever maintained by the "employer" (or a "predecessor employer") under which the
Participant receives "annual additions" (including voluntary employee contribution accounts in a defined benefit plan, mandatory
contributions to a defined benefit plan, individual medical benefit accounts underÂ§401(h), key employee accounts under a welfare
benefit plan described in Â§419, and simplified employee pensions underÂ§408(k)) of the employer or a predecessor employer,
whether or not terminated, will be treated as one defined contribution plan for purposes of the limitations underÂ§ 415(c). Where
the employer is a member of a controlled group of corporations or commonly controlled trades or businesses, or a member of an
affiliated service group, within the meaning of Â§Â§414(b), (c) or (m) and 415(g) and (h), the plan must provide that all such
employers are treated as a single employer for purposes of the plan's application of the Â§415 limitations. Notwithstanding the
preceding, multiemployer plans are not aggregated with other multiemployer plans for purposes of Â§415. For purposes of this
Section:
(i) A former "employer" is a "predecessor employer" with respect to a participant in a plan maintained by an "employer" if
the "employer" maintains a plan under which the participant had accrued a benefit while performing services for the former
"employer," but only if that benefit is provided under the plan maintained by the "employer." For this purpose, the "formerly
affiliated plan" rules in Regulation Â§1.415(f)-1(b)(2) apply as if the "employer" and "predecessor employer" constituted a
single employer under the rules described in Regulation Â§1.415(a)-1(f)(1) and (2) immediately prior to the "cessation of
affiliation" (and as if they constituted two, unrelated employers under the rules described in Regulation Â§1.415(a)-1(f)(1)
and (2) immediately after the "cessation of affiliation") and "cessation of affiliation" was the event that gives rise to the
"predecessor employer" relationship, such as a transfer of benefits or plan sponsorship.
(ii) With respect to an "employer" of a Participant, a former entity that antedates the "employer" is a "predecessor
employer" with respect to the Participant if, under the facts and circumstances, the "employer" constitutes a continuation of
all or a portion of the trade or business of the former entity.
(2) Break-up of an affiliated employer or an affiliated service group. For purposes of aggregating plans for Code Â§415, a
"formerly affiliated plan" of an "employer" is taken into account for purposes of applying the Code Â§415 limitations to the
"employer," but the "formerly affiliated plan" is treated as if it had terminated immediately prior to the "cessation of affiliation."
For purposes of this paragraph, a "formerly affiliated plan" of an "employer" is a plan that, immediately prior to the "cessation of
affiliation," was actually maintained by one or more of the entities that constitute the "employer" (as determined under the
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers
32

[PAGE 38]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
employer affiliation rules described in Regulation Â§1.415(a)-1(f)(1) and (2)), and immediately after the "cessation of affiliation,"
is not actually maintained by any of the entities that constitute the "employer" (as determined under the employer affiliation rules
described in Regulation Â§1.415(a)-1(f)(1) and (2)). For purposes of this paragraph, a "cessation of affiliation" means the event
that causes an entity to no longer be aggregated with one or more other entities as a single "employer" under the employer
affiliation rules described in Regulation Â§1.415(a)-1(f)(1) and (2) (such as the sale of a subsidiary outside a controlled group), or
that causes a plan to not actually be maintained by any of the entities that constitute the "employer" under the employer affiliation
rules of Regulation Â§1.415(a)-1(f)(1) and (2) (such as a transfer of plan sponsorship outside of a controlled group).
(3) Mid-year aggregation. Two or more defined contribution plans that are not required to be aggregated pursuant to Code
Â§415(f) and the Regulations thereunder as of the first day of a Limitation Year do not fail to satisfy the requirements of Code
Â§415 with respect to a Participant for the Limitation Year merely because they are aggregated later in that Limitation Year,
provided that no "annual additions" are credited to the Participant's Account after the date on which the plans are required to be
aggregated.
4.5 ADJUSTMENT FOR EXCESS ANNUAL ADDITIONS
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, if the "annual additions" (as defined in Section 4.4) are exceeded for any
Participant, then the Plan may only correct such excess in accordance with the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS) as
set forth in Rev. Proc. 2018-52, Rev. Proc. 2019-19, or any superseding guidance.
4.6 ROLLOVERS
(a) Acceptance of "rollovers" into the Plan. If elected in the Adoption Agreement and with the consent of the Administrator (such
consent must be exercised in a nondiscriminatory manner and applied uniformly to all Participants), the Plan may accept a "rollover,"
provided the "rollover" will not jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the Plan or create adverse tax consequences for the Employer. The
amounts rolled over shall be separately accounted for in a "Participant's Rollover Account." Furthermore, any Roth Elective Deferrals
that are accepted as "rollovers" in this Plan on or after January 1, 2006 shall be separately accounted for. A Participant's Rollover
Account shall be fully Vested at all times and shall not be subject to Forfeiture for any reason. For purposes of this Section, the term
Participant shall include any Eligible Employee who is not yet a Participant, if, pursuant to the Adoption Agreement, "rollovers" are
permitted to be accepted from Eligible Employees. In addition, for purposes of this Section the term Participant shall also include
Former Employees if the Employer and Administrator consent to accept "rollovers" of distributions made to Former Employees from
any plan of the Employer. Regardless of whether new loans are permitted, if the Plan permits rollovers, the Administrator may, in a
uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, accept rollovers of loans into this Plan if the terms of such loans meet the requirements of
being definite, have a reasonable rate of interest, and/or have a definite repayment period (e.g., an asset purchase acquisition whereby
the acquiring Employer may choose to accept the rollover of Participant loans from a prior employer in a uniform and
nondiscriminatory manner).
(b) Treatment of "rollovers" under the Plan. Amounts in a Participant's Rollover Account shall be held by the Trustee (or Insurer)
pursuant to the provisions of this Plan and may not be withdrawn by, or distributed to the Participant, in whole or in part, except as
elected in the Adoption Agreement and Subsection (c) below. The Trustee (or Insurer) shall have no duty or responsibility to inquire
as to the propriety of the amount, value or type of assets transferred, nor to conduct any due diligence with respect to such assets;
provided, however, that such assets are otherwise eligible to be held by the Trustee (or Insurer) under the terms of this Plan.
(c) Distribution of "rollovers." At such time as the conditions set forth in the Adoption Agreement have been satisfied, the
Administrator, at the election of the Participant, shall direct the distribution of up to the entire amount credited to the Rollover
Account maintained on behalf of such Participant. Any distribution of amounts held in a Participant's Rollover Account shall be made
in a manner which is consistent with and satisfies the provisions of Sections 6.5 and 6.6, including, but not limited to, all notice and
consent requirements of Code Â§Â§411(a)(11) and 417 and the Regulations thereunder. Furthermore, unless otherwise elected in the
Adoption Agreement, such amounts shall be considered to be part of a Participant's benefit in determining whether an involuntary
cash-out of benefits may be made without Participant consent.
(d) "Rollovers" maintained in a separate account. The Administrator may direct that "rollovers" made after a Valuation Date be
segregated into a separate account for each Participant until such time as the allocations pursuant to this Plan have been made, at
which time they may remain segregated, invested as part of the general Trust Fund or, if elected in the Adoption Agreement, directed
by the Participant.
(e) Limits on accepting "rollovers." Prior to accepting any "rollovers" to which this Section applies, the Administrator may require
the Employee to establish (by providing opinion of counsel or otherwise) that the amounts to be rolled over to this Plan meet the
requirements of this Section. The Employer may instruct the Administrator, operationally and on a nondiscriminatory basis, to limit
the source of "rollover" contributions that may be accepted by the Plan.

[PAGE 39]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(f) Definitions. For purposes of this Section, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) A "rollover" means: (i) amounts transferred to this Plan directly from another "eligible retirement plan;" (ii) distributions
received by an Employee from other "eligible retirement plans" which are eligible for tax-free rollover to an "eligible retirement
plan" and which are transferred by the Employee to this Plan within sixty (60) days following receipt thereof; and (iii) any other
amounts which are eligible to be rolled over to this Plan pursuant to the Code or any other federally enacted legislation.
(2) An "eligible retirement plan" means an individual retirement account described in Code Â§408(a), an individual retirement
annuity described in Code Â§408(b) (other than an endowment contract), a qualified trust (an employees' trust described in Code
Â§401(a) which is exempt from tax under Code Â§501(a)), an annuity plan described in Code Â§403(a), an eligible deferred
compensation plan described in Code Â§457(b) which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Code Â§457(e)(1)(A), and
an annuity contract described in Code Â§403(b).
(g) Pre-Participation Rollovers. If an Eligible Employee makes a Rollover Contribution to the Plan prior to satisfying the Plan's
eligibility conditions or prior to reaching his or her Entry Date, then the Administrator will treat the Employee as a limited Participant
(as described in Rev. Rul. 96-48). A limited Participant does not share in the Plan's allocation of Employer Contributions nor
Forfeitures and may not make Elective Deferrals if the Plan is a 401(k) Plan, until the Employee actually becomes a Participant in the
Plan.
4.7 PLAN-TO-PLAN TRANSFERS FROM QUALIFIED PLANS
(a) Transfers into this Plan. With the consent of the Administrator, amounts may be transferred (within the meaning of
Code Â§414(l)) to this Plan from other tax qualified plans under Code Â§401(a), provided the plan from which such funds are transferred
permits the transfer to be made and the transfer will not jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the Plan or Trust or create adverse tax
consequences for the Employer. Prior to accepting any transfers to which this Section applies, the Administrator may require an
opinion of counsel that the amounts to be transferred meet the requirements of this Section. The amounts transferred shall be set up in
a separate account herein referred to as a "Participant's Transfer Account." Furthermore, for vesting purposes, the Participant's
Transfer Account may be treated as a separate "Participant's Account."
(b) Accounting of transfers. Amounts in a Participant's Transfer Account shall be held by the Trustee (or Insurer) pursuant to the
provisions of this Plan and may not be withdrawn by, or distributed to the Participant, in whole or in part, except as elected in the
Adoption Agreement and Subsection (d) below, provided the restrictions of Subsection (c) below and Section 6.16 are satisfied. The
Trustee (or Insurer) shall have no duty or responsibility to inquire as to the propriety of the amount, value or type of assets transferred,
nor to conduct any due diligence with respect to such assets; provided, however, that such assets are otherwise eligible to be held by
the Trustee (or Insurer) under the terms of this Plan. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, transferred amounts are
not required to be separately accounted for and may be combined with the corresponding Account maintained in this Plan provided all
rights, benefits and features and other attributes are identical with respect to each account, or are identical after the combination and
such combination does not result in the impermissible elimination of any Code Â§411(d)(6) protected benefits.
(c) Restrictions on Elective Deferrals. Except as permitted by Regulations (including Regulation Â§1.411(d)-4), amounts
attributable to elective contributions (as defined in Regulation Â§1.401(k)-6), including amounts treated as elective contributions, which
are transferred from another qualified plan in a plan-to-plan transfer (other than a direct rollover) shall be subject to the distribution
limitations provided for in the Code Â§401(k) Regulations.
(d) Distribution of plan-to-plan transfer amounts. At Normal Retirement Date, or such other date when the Participant or the
Participant's Beneficiary shall be entitled to receive benefits, the Participant's Transfer Account shall be used to provide additional
benefits to the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary. Any distribution of amounts held in a Participant's Transfer Account shall
be made in a manner which is consistent with and satisfies the provisions of Sections 6.5 and 6.6, including, but not limited to, all
notice and consent requirements of Code Â§Â§411(a)(11) and 417 and the Regulations thereunder. Furthermore, such amounts shall be
considered to be part of a Participant's benefit in determining whether an involuntary cash-out of benefits may be made without
Participant consent.
(e) Segregation. The Administrator may direct that Employee transfers made after a Valuation Date be segregated into a separate
account for each Participant until such time as the allocations pursuant to this Plan have been made, at which time they may remain
segregated, invested as part of the general Trust Fund or, if elected in the Adoption Agreement, directed by the Participant.
(f) Protected benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a transfer directly to this Plan from another qualified plan
(or a transaction having the effect of such a transfer) shall not result in the elimination or reduction of any "Section 411(d)(6)
protected benefit" (as described in Section 8.1(e)) that may not be eliminated or reduced pursuant to Regulation Â§1.411(d)-4.
(g) Pre-Participation Transfers. The Administrator has the discretion to accept a Transfer of plan assets on behalf of an Employee
prior to the date the Employee satisfies the Plan's eligibility conditions or prior to reaching the Entry Date in a uniform and
nondiscriminatory manner. If the Plan accepts such a direct transfer of plan assets, then the Administrator will treat the Employee as a
limited Participant pursuant to Section 4.6(g).

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(h) Elective Transfers. The Administrator may authorize the Trustee to (in accordance with the proper election of a Participant or
Beneficiary), to enter into an agreement with the trustee of any other plan to transfer as an âElective Transferâ to the other plan or to
receive as an âElective Transferâ into this Plan, all or a portion of the Account of the electing Participant or Beneficiary. The specific
requirements for an âElective Transferâ depend upon the type of âElective Transferâ that is utilized to effect the transfer, as described
herein.
(1) Definition of âElective Transfer.â An âElective Transferâ is a transfer made at the election of a Participant (or, as applicable,
a Beneficiary) and which satisfies the requirements of this Subsection (h).
(2) Code Â§411(d)(6)(D) transfer. A Code Â§411(d)(6)(D) Transfer means a transfer under Code Â§411(d)(6)(D) between defined
contribution plans, and which a Participant or Beneficiary elects following required statutory notice. Under this Subsection
(h)(2), the, the Account need not be distributable at the time of transfer and Code Â§411(d)(6) protected benefits specifically
relating to distribution methods do not carry over to the transferee plan, except, if applicable, the qualified joint and survivor
annuity rules set forth in Sections 6.5 and 6.6.
(3) Acquisition or employment change transfer. An acquisition or employment change transfer means a transfer under
Regulation Â§1.411(d)-4 Q/A-3(b), between such defined contribution plans as described therein, and which a Participant elects.
Under this Subsection (h)(3), the Account need not be distributable at the time of transfer and Code Â§411(d)(6) protected benefits
do not carry over to the transferee plan, except, if applicable, the qualified joint and survivor annuity rules set forth in Sections
6.5 and 6.6.
(4) Distributable event transfer. A distributable event transfer means a transfer under Regulation Â§1.411(d)-4 Q/A-3(c), between
Code Â§401(a) plans, and which a Participant elects. Under this Subsection (h)(4), the Account must be distributable at the time of
transfer, but not entirely as a lump-sum which is an eligible rollover distribution. Code Â§411(d)(6) protected benefits do not carry
over to the transferee plan
4.8 AFTER-TAX VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS
(a) Not permitted in Money Purchase or Profit Sharing Plan. Except as provided in Section 4.8(b) below, this Plan will not
accept after-tax voluntary Employee contributions. If this is an amendment to a Plan that had previously allowed after-tax voluntary
Employee contributions, then this Plan will not accept after-tax voluntary Employee contributions for Plan Years beginning after the
Plan Year in which this Plan is adopted by the Employer.
(b) After-tax voluntary Employee contributions allowed in 401(k) Plans. For 401(k) Plans, if elected in the Adoption Agreement,
each Participant who is eligible to make Elective Deferrals may, in accordance with nondiscriminatory procedures established by the
Administrator, elect to make after-tax voluntary Employee contributions to this Plan. Such contributions must generally be paid to the
Trustee (or Insurer) within a reasonable period of time after being received by the Employer. An after-tax voluntary Employee
contribution is any contribution (other than Roth Elective Deferrals) made to the Plan by or on behalf of a Participant that is included
in the Participant's gross income in the year in which made and that is separately accounted for under the Plan.
(c) Full vesting. The balance in each Participant's Voluntary Contribution Account shall be fully Vested at all times and shall not be
subject to Forfeiture for any reason.
(d) Distribution at any time. A Participant may elect at any time to withdraw after-tax voluntary Employee contributions from such
Participant's Voluntary Contribution Account and the actual earnings thereon in a manner which is consistent with and satisfies the
provisions of Section 6.5, including, but not limited to, all notice and consent requirements of Code Â§Â§411(a)(11) and 417 and the
Regulations thereunder. If the Administrator maintains sub-accounts with respect to after-tax voluntary Employee contributions (and
earnings thereon) which were made on or before a specified date, a Participant shall be permitted to designate which sub-account shall
be the source for the withdrawal. Forfeitures of Employer contributions shall not occur solely as a result of an Employee's withdrawal
of after-tax voluntary Employee contributions.
In the event a Participant has received a hardship distribution under the safe harbor hardship provisions of the Code Â§401(k)
Regulations from any plan maintained by the Employer, then the Participant shall be barred from making any after-tax voluntary
Employee contributions for a period of six (6) months after receipt of the hardship distribution. Any prior elections to make after-tax
voluntary Employee contributions will become void upon the receipt of the hardship distribution that triggers the suspension period of
this paragraph.
(e) Used to provide benefits. At Normal Retirement Date, or such other date when the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary is
entitled to receive benefits, the Participant's Voluntary Contribution Account shall be used to provide additional benefits to the
Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary.
(f) Prior mandatory contributions. To the extent a Participant has previously made mandatory Employee contributions under prior
provisions of this Plan, such contributions will be treated as after-tax voluntary Employee contributions, except that the provisions of
Subsection (d) above permitting a distribution at any time shall not apply to mandatory Employee contributions.

4.9 QUALIFIED VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS
(a) Maintenance of existing QVEC Accounts. If this is an amendment to a Plan that previously permitted deductible voluntary
Employee contributions, then each Participant who made "qualified voluntary Employee contributions" within the meaning of Code
Â§219(e)(2) as it existed prior to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, shall have such contributions held in a separate
Qualified Voluntary Employee Contribution Account which shall be fully Vested at all times. Such contributions, however, shall not
be permitted for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.
(b) Distribution from QVEC Account. A Participant may, upon written request delivered to the Administrator, make withdrawals
from such Participant's Qualified Voluntary Employee Contribution Account. Any distribution shall be made in a manner which is
consistent with and satisfies the provisions of Section 6.5, including, but not limited to, all notice and consent requirements of Code
Â§Â§411(a)(11) and 417 and the Regulations thereunder.
(c) Used to provide benefits. At Normal Retirement Date, or such other date when the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary is
entitled to receive benefits, the Qualified Voluntary Employee Contribution Account shall be used to provide additional benefits to the
Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary.
4.10 PARTICIPANT DIRECTED INVESTMENTS
(a) Directed investment options allowed. If permitted by the Administrator and the terms of the Trust, Participants may direct the
Trustee (or Insurer) as to the investment of all or a portion of their individual Account balances in accordance with the Plan's
procedures. Participants may direct the Trustee (or Insurer), in writing (or in such other form which is acceptable to the Trustee (or
Insurer)), to invest their accounts in specific assets, specific funds or other investments permitted under the Plan and the Participant
Direction Procedures. That portion of the Account of any Participant that is subject to investment direction of such Participant will be
considered a Participant Directed Account.
(b) Establishment of Participant Direction Procedures. The Administrator will establish Participant Direction Procedures, to be
applied in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, setting forth the permissible investment options under this Section, how often
changes between investments may be made, and any other limitations and provisions that the Administrator may impose on a
Participant's right to direct investments.
(c) Administrative discretion. The Administrator may, in its discretion, include or exclude by amendment or other action from the
Participant Direction Procedures such instructions, guidelines or policies as it deems necessary or appropriate to ensure proper
administration of the Plan, and may interpret the same accordingly.
(d) Allocation of gains or losses. As of each Valuation Date, all Participant Directed Accounts shall be charged or credited with the
net earnings, gains, losses and expenses as well as any appreciation or depreciation in the market value using publicly listed fair
market values when available or appropriate as follows:
(1) to the extent the assets in a Participant Directed Account are accounted for as pooled assets or investments, the allocation of
earnings, gains and losses of each Participant's Account shall be based upon the total amount of funds so invested in a manner
proportionate to the Participant's share of such pooled investment; and
(2) to the extent the assets in a Participant Directed Account are accounted for as segregated assets, the allocation of earnings,
gains on and losses from such assets shall be made on a separate and distinct basis.
(e) Plan will follow investment directions. Investment directions will be processed as soon as administratively practicable after
proper investment directions are received from the Participant. No guarantee is made by the Plan, Employer, Administrator or Trustee
(or Insurer) that investment directions will be processed on a daily basis, and no guarantee is made in any respect regarding the
processing time of an investment direction. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Employer, Administrator or
Discretionary Trustee (or Insurer) reserves the right to not value an investment option on any given Valuation Date for any reason
deemed appropriate by the Employer, Administrator or Discretionary Trustee (or Insurer). Furthermore, the processing of any
investment transaction may be delayed for any legitimate business reason (including, but not limited to, failure of systems or computer
programs, failure of the means of the transmission of data, the failure of a service provider to timely receive values or prices, and
correction for errors or omissions or the errors or omissions of any service provider) or force majeure. The processing date of a
transaction will be binding for all purposes of the Plan and considered the applicable Valuation Date for an investment transaction.
(f) Other documents required by directed investments. Any information regarding investments available under the Plan, to the
extent not required to be described in the Participant Direction Procedures, may be provided to Participants in one or more documents
(or in any other form, including, but not limited to, electronic media) which are separate from the Participant Direction Procedures and
are not thereby incorporated by reference into this Plan.

4.11 INTEGRATION IN MORE THAN ONE PLAN
If the Employer maintains qualified retirement plans that provide for permitted disparity (integration), the provisions of
Section 4.3(b)(2) will apply.
4.12 QUALIFIED MILITARY SERVICE
(a) USERRA. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to
qualified military service will be provided in accordance with Code Â§414(u). Furthermore, loan repayments may be suspended under
this Plan as permitted under Code Â§414(u)(4).
(b) Qualified reservist distribution. If elected in the Adoption Agreement, a Participant may elect to receive a "qualified reservist
distribution." A "qualified reservist distribution" is any distribution to an individual who is ordered or called to active duty, if: (1) the
distribution is from amounts attributable to elective deferrals in a 401(k) plan; (2) the individual was (by reason of being a member of
a reserve component, as defined in section 101 of title 37, United States Code) ordered or called to active duty for a period in excess
of 179 days or for an indefinite period; and (3) the Plan makes the distribution during the period beginning on the date of such order or
call, and ending at the close of the active duty period.
(c) Benefit accrual. If the Employer elects in the Adoption Agreement to apply this Subsection, then for benefit accrual purposes,
the Plan treats an individual who becomes Totally and Permanently disabled or dies while performing "qualified military service" (as
defined in Code Â§414(u)) with respect to the Employer as if the individual had resumed employment in accordance with the
individual's reemployment rights under Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended
(USERRA), on the day preceding Total and Permanent Disability and terminated employment on the actual date of Total and
Permanent Disability.
The Plan will determine the amount of after-tax voluntary Employee contributions and Elective Deferrals of an individual treated as
reemployed under this Section for purposes of applying paragraph Code Â§414(u)(8)(C) on the basis of the individual's average actual
after-tax voluntary Employee contributions or Elective Deferrals for the lesser of: (1) the 12-month period of service with the
Employer immediately prior to "qualified military service" (as defined in Code Â§414(u)); or (2) the actual length of continuous service
with the Employer.
(d) Death benefits. If a Participant dies while performing "qualified military service" (as defined in Code Â§414(u)), the Participant's
Beneficiary is entitled to any additional benefits (other than benefit accruals (unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement) relating
to the period of "qualified military service" but including vesting credit for such period and any other ancillary life insurance or other
survivor benefits) provided under the Plan as if the Participant had resumed employment and then terminated employment on account of
death. Moreover, the Plan will credit the Participant's "qualified military service" as service for vesting purposes, as though the Participant
had resumed employment under Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended (USERRA)
immediately prior to the Participant's death.
(e) Military Differential Pay. The following applies with respect to Military Differential Pay: (1) an individual receiving Military
Differential Pay is treated as an Employee of the Employer making the payment; (2) the Military Differential Pay is treated as 415
Compensation (and Compensation unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement); and (3) the Plan is not treated as failing to meet
the requirements of any provision described in Code Â§414(u)(1)(C) (or corresponding Plan provisions, including, but not limited to, Plan
provisions related to the ADP or ACP test) by reason of any contribution or benefit which is based on the Military Differential Pay. The
Administrator operationally may determine, for purposes of the provisions described in Code Â§414(u)(1)(C), whether to take into account
any Elective Deferrals, and if applicable, any matching contributions, attributable to Military Differential Pay.
Subsection (e)(3) above applies only if all Employees of the Employer performing service in the uniformed services described in
Code Â§3401(h)(2)(A) are entitled to receive Military Differential Pay on reasonably equivalent terms and, if eligible to participate in a
retirement plan maintained by the Employer, to make contributions based on the payments on reasonably equivalent terms (taking into
account Code Â§410(b)(3), (4), and (5)).
(f) Deemed Severance. Notwithstanding Subsection (e)(1) above, if elected in the Adoption Agreement, a Participant who performs
service in the uniformed services (as defined in Code Â§414(u)(12)(B)) on active duty for a period of more than thirty (30) days, the
Participant will be deemed to have a severance from employment solely for purposes of eligibility for distribution of amounts not subject to
Code Â§412. However, the Plan will not distribute such a Participant's Account on account of this deemed severance unless the Participant
specifically elects to receive a benefit distribution hereunder. If a Participant elects to receive a distribution of Elective Deferrals on
account of this deemed severance, then the individual may not make an Elective Deferral or after-tax voluntary Employee contribution
during the six (6) month period beginning on the date of the distribution. If a Participant would be entitled to a distribution on account of a
deemed severance, and a distribution on account of another Plan provision (such as a "qualified reservist distribution" as defined in
Subsection (a) above), then the other Plan provision will control and the six (6) month suspension will not apply.

4.13 TRANSFER OF ASSETS FROM TERMINATED EMPLOYER DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN
(a) Transferred DB Assets. The Employer may transfer an amount to this Plan from the Employer's terminated defined benefit plan
in accordance with Code Â§4980(d)(2)(B). The amounts transferred into this Plan shall be held in a "transferred assets suspension
account." Amounts released from the "transferred assets suspension account" pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall be
allocated in the same manner and to the same Participants that Employer Nonelective Contributions are allocated, as described in
Section 4.3. If the Plan does not provide for Nonelective Contributions, then the amounts released from the "transferred assets
suspension account" pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall be allocated to each Participant eligible to share in allocations in
the same ratio as such Participant's Compensation bears to the total Compensation of all Participants eligible to share in allocations.
The Employer may, however, designate some or all of the allocated amounts as Qualified Non-Elective Contributions. Amounts
transferred to the Plan pursuant to this Section may not, however, be used to offset any matching contributions permitted under the
Plan.
The Employer will determine, in its discretion, the amount to be released from the "transferred suspension account." However,
the minimum amount that shall be released from the "transferred assets suspension account" for any Plan Year is the percentage of the
account based on the following table:
Years Since Transfer Percentage of Suspense Account
0 14.2857%
1 16.6667%
2 20.0000%
3 25.0000%
4 33.3333%
5 50.0000%
6 100.0000%
(b) Earnings. The amount in the "transferred suspension account" shall be credited with earnings and losses as of each Valuation
Date in accordance with Section 4.3, except that Participants may not direct the investment of amounts in the "transferred suspension
account." Amounts released from the account prior to the last day of a Plan Year shall not share in such earnings or losses.
(c) Annual additions. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, amounts in the "transferred suspension account" shall
not be treated as "annual additions" pursuant to Section 4.4 until such amounts are released and allocated to Participants.
(d) Plan termination. If upon the termination of the Plan any amount credited to the "transferred suspension account" remains
unallocated, then such amount shall be allocated as provided above to the Accounts of Participants as of such date of Plan termination,
but limited as to each Participant to avoid allocating exceeding the limitations of Code Â§415 as set forth in Section 4.4. Any amount
that cannot be allocated to a Participant under the preceding sentence shall be reallocated to remaining Participants, but only to the
extent that no Participant receives an amount that exceeds the limitations of Code Â§415 as set forth in Section 4.4. The reallocation
process will continue until all amounts in the "transferred suspension account" have been reallocated. If all Participants have received
the maximum "annual addition" permitted pursuant to Section 4.4, then any remaining amounts shall revert to the Employer.
ARTICLE V
VALUATIONS
5.1 VALUATION OF THE TRUST FUND
The Administrator shall direct the Trustee (or Insurer), as of each Valuation Date, to determine the net worth of the assets comprising
the Trust Fund as it exists on the Valuation Date. In determining such net worth, the Trustee (or Insurer) shall value the assets comprising
the Trust Fund at their fair market value as of the Valuation Date and may deduct all expenses for which the Trustee (or Insurer) has not yet
been paid by the Employer or the Trust Fund. The Trustee (or Insurer), when determining the net worth of the assets, may update the value
of any shares held in a Participant Directed Account by reference to the number of shares held on behalf of the Participant, priced at the
market value as of the Valuation Date.
5.2 METHOD OF VALUATION
Except as otherwise provided in the Trust agreement, in determining the fair market value of securities held in the Trust Fund which
are listed on a registered stock exchange, the Administrator shall direct the Trustee (or Insurer) to value the same at the prices they were
last traded on such exchange preceding the close of business on the Valuation Date. If such securities were not traded on the Valuation
Date, or if the exchange on which they are traded was not open for business on the Valuation Date, then the securities shall be valued at the
prices at which they were last traded prior to the Valuation Date. Any unlisted security held in the Trust Fund shall be valued at its bid
price next preceding the close of business on the Valuation Date, which bid price shall be obtained from a registered broker or an
investment banker. In determining the fair market value of assets other than securities for which trading or bid prices can be obtained, the
Trustee, the Administrator (if the Trustee is a directed Trustee), or Insurer may appraise such assets itself (assuming it has the appropriate

expertise), or in its discretion, employ one or more appraisers for that purpose and rely on the values established by such appraiser or
appraisers.
ARTICLE VI
DETERMINATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS
6.1 DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS UPON RETIREMENT
Every Participant may terminate employment with the Employer and retire for purposes hereof on the Participant's Normal Retirement
Date or Early Retirement Date. However, a Participant may postpone the severance of employment with the Employer to a later date, in
which event the participation of such Participant in the Plan, including the right to receive allocations pursuant to Section 4.3, shall
continue until such Participant's Retirement Date. Upon a Participant's Retirement Date, or if elected in the Adoption Agreement, the
attainment of Normal Retirement Date without severance of employment with the Employer (subject to Sections 6.11 and 12.2(e)), or as
soon thereafter as is practicable, the Administrator shall direct the distribution, at the election of the Participant (unless a distribution is
mandatory under the other terms of the Plan), of the Participant's entire Vested interest in the Plan in accordance with Section 6.5.
6.2 DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS UPON DEATH
(a) 100% vesting on death. Upon the death of a Participant before the Participant's Retirement Date or other severance of
employment, all amounts credited to such Participant's Combined Account shall, if elected in the Adoption Agreement, become fully
Vested. The Administrator shall direct, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 6.6 and 6.7, the distribution of the deceased
Participant's Vested accounts to the Participant's Beneficiary.
(b) Distribution upon death. Upon the death of a Participant, the Administrator shall direct, in accordance with the provisions of
Sections 6.6 and 6.7, the distribution of any remaining Vested amounts credited to the accounts of such deceased Participant to such
Participant's Beneficiary.
(c) Determination of death benefit by Administrator. The Administrator may require such proper proof of death and such
evidence of the right of any person to receive payment of the value of the account of a deceased Participant as the Administrator may
deem desirable. The Administrator's determination of death and of the right of any person to receive payment shall be conclusive.
(d) Beneficiary designation. Unless otherwise elected in the manner prescribed in Section 6.6, the Beneficiary of the Pre-Retirement
Survivor Annuity shall be the Participant's surviving Spouse. Except, however, the Participant may designate a Beneficiary other than
the Spouse for the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity if:
(1) the Participant and the Participant's Spouse have validly waived the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity in the manner
prescribed in Section 6.6, and the Spouse has waived the right to be the Participant's Beneficiary,
(2) the Participant is legally separated or has been abandoned (within the meaning of local law) and the Participant has a court
order to such effect (and there is no "qualified domestic relations order" as defined in Code Â§414(p) which provides otherwise),
(3) the Participant has no Spouse, or
(4) the Spouse cannot be located.
In such event, the designation of a Beneficiary shall be made on a form satisfactory to the Administrator. A Participant may at
any time revoke a designation of a Beneficiary or change a Beneficiary by filing written (or in such other form as permitted by the
IRS) notice of such revocation or change with the Administrator. However, the Participant's Spouse must again consent in writing (or
in such other form as permitted by the IRS) to any change in Beneficiary unless the original consent acknowledged that the Spouse
had the right to limit consent only to a specific Beneficiary and that the Spouse voluntarily elected to relinquish such right.
(e) Beneficiary if no Beneficiary elected by Participant. A Participant may, at any time, designate a Beneficiary for death benefits,
if any, payable under the Plan that are in excess of the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity without the waiver or consent of the
Participant's Spouse. In the event no valid designation of Beneficiary exists, or if the Beneficiary with respect to a portion of a
Participant's death benefit is not alive at the time of the Participant's death and no contingent Beneficiary has been designated, then
such portion of the death benefit will be paid in the following order of priority, unless the Employer specifies a different order of
priority in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective Dates and Other Permitted Elections), to:
(1) The Participant's surviving Spouse;
(2) The Participant's issue, per stirpes;
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers
39

[PAGE 45]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(3) The Participant's surviving parents, in equal shares; or
(4) The Participant's estate.
If the Beneficiary does not predecease the Participant, but dies prior to distribution of the death benefit, the death benefit
will be paid to the Beneficiary's "designated Beneficiary" (or if there is no "designated Beneficiary," to the Beneficiary's estate).
For purposes of these provisions, and with respect to any Beneficiary designations, adopted children shall be treated as children.
(f) Divorce revokes spousal Beneficiary designation. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, unless otherwise
elected in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective Dates and Other Permitted Elections), if a Participant has
designated the Spouse as a Beneficiary, then a divorce decree that relates to such Spouse shall revoke the Participant's designation of
the Spouse as a Beneficiary unless the decree or a "qualified domestic relations order" (within the meaning of Code Â§414(p)) provides
otherwise or a subsequent Beneficiary designation is made.
(g) Simultaneous death of Participant and Beneficiary. If a Participant and his or her Beneficiary should die simultaneously, or
under circumstances that render it difficult or impossible to determine who predeceased the other, then unless the Participant's
Beneficiary designation otherwise specifies, the Administrator will presume conclusively that the Beneficiary predeceased the
Participant.
(h) Slayer statute. The Administrator may apply slayer statutes, or similar rules which prohibit inheritance by a person who murders
someone from whom he or she stands to inherit, under applicable state laws.
(i) Insured death benefit. If the Plan provides an insured death benefit and a Participant dies before any insurance coverage to
which the Participant is entitled under the Plan is effected, the death benefit from such insurance coverage shall be limited to the
premium which was or otherwise would have been used for such purpose.
(j) Plan terms control. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Plan and the terms of any Contract issued hereunder,
the Plan provisions shall control.
6.3 DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS IN EVENT OF DISABILITY
In the event of a Participant's Total and Permanent Disability prior to the Participant's Retirement Date or other severance of
employment, all amounts credited to such Participant's Combined Account shall, if elected in the Adoption Agreement, become fully
Vested. In the event of a Participant's Total and Permanent Disability, the Participant's entire Vested interest in the Plan will be
distributable and may be distributed in accordance with the provisions of Sections 6.5 and 6.7.
6.4 DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS UPON TERMINATION
(a) Payment on severance of employment. If a Participant's employment with the Employer and any Affiliated Employer is severed
for any reason other than death, Total and Permanent Disability, or attainment of the Participant's Retirement Date, then such
Participant shall be entitled to such benefits as are provided herein.
Distribution of the funds due to a Terminated Participant shall be made on the occurrence of an event which would result in the
distribution had the Terminated Participant remained in the employ of the Employer (upon the Participant's death, Total and Permanent
Disability, Early or Normal Retirement). However, at the election of the Participant, the Administrator shall direct that the entire Vested
portion of the Terminated Participant's Combined Account be payable to such Terminated Participant provided the conditions, if any, set
forth in the Adoption Agreement have been satisfied. Any distribution under this paragraph shall be made in a manner which is consistent
with and satisfies the provisions of Section 6.5, including but not limited to, all notice and consent requirements of Code Â§Â§411(a)(11) and
417 and the Regulations thereunder.
Regardless of whether distributions in kind are permitted, in the event the amount of the Vested portion of the Terminated Participant's
Combined Account equals or exceeds the fair market value of any insurance Contracts, the Administrator may direct the Trustee (or
Insurer), when agreed to by the Terminated Participant, to assign, transfer, and set over to such Terminated Participant all Contracts on
such Terminated Participant's life in such form or with such endorsements, so that the settlement options and forms of payment are
consistent with the provisions of Section 6.5. In the event that the Terminated Participant's Vested portion does not at least equal the fair
market value of the Contracts, if any, the Terminated Participant may pay over to the Trustee (or Insurer) the sum needed to make the
distribution equal to the value of the Contracts being assigned or transferred, or the Trustee (or Insurer), pursuant to the Participant's
election, may borrow the cash value of the Contracts from the Insurer so that the value of the Contracts is equal to the Vested portion of the
Terminated Participant's Combined Account and then assign the Contracts to the Terminated Participant.
Notwithstanding the above, unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, if the value of a Terminated Participant's Vested
benefit derived from Employer and Employee contributions does not exceed $5,000 (or such lower amount as elected in the Adoption
Agreement), the Administrator shall direct that the entire Vested benefit be paid to such Participant in a single lump-sum as soon as
practical without regard to the consent of the Participant, provided the conditions, if any, set forth in the Adoption Agreement have been
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers
40

[PAGE 46]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
satisfied. A Participant's Vested benefit shall not include (1) qualified voluntary employee contributions within the meaning of Code
Â§72(o)(5)(B) and (2) if selected in the Conditions for Distributions Upon Severance of Employment Section of the Adoption Agreement,
the Participant's Rollover Account. If a mandatory distribution is made pursuant to this paragraph and such distribution is greater than
$1,000 and the Participant does not elect to have such distribution paid directly to an "eligible retirement plan" specified by the Participant
in a "direct rollover" in accordance with Section 6.15 or to receive the distribution directly, then the Administrator shall transfer such
amount to an individual retirement account described in Code Â§408(a) or an individual retirement annuity described in Code Â§408(b)
designated by the Administrator. However, if the Participant elects to receive or make a "direct rollover" of such amount, then the
Administrator shall direct the Trustee (or Insurer) to cause the entire Vested benefit to be paid to such Participant in a single lump sum, or
make a "direct rollover" pursuant to Section 6.15, provided the conditions, if any, set forth in the Adoption Agreement have been satisfied.
The Administrator may establish a uniform and nondiscriminatory procedure as to whether a Participant who fails to make an Affirmative
Election with respect to a mandatory distribution of $1,000 or less is treated as having made a "direct rollover" election. For purposes of
determining whether the $1,000 threshold set forth in this paragraph is met, the mandatory distribution includes amounts in a Participant's
Rollover Account. For purposes of determining whether the $5,000 threshold in this paragraph is met, a Participant's Rollover Account is
taken into account unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement. Furthermore, for purposes of applying the $1,000 threshold, the
Administrator may apply this paragraph by treating a Participant's Roth Elective Deferral Account separately from the Participant's other
Accounts.
(b) Vesting schedule. The Vested portion of any Participant's Account shall be a percentage of such Participant's Account
determined on the basis of the Participant's number of Years of Service (or Periods of Service if the elapsed time method is elected)
according to the vesting schedule specified in the Adoption Agreement. However, a Participant's entire interest in the Plan shall be
non-forfeitable upon the Participant's Normal Retirement Age (if the Participant is employed by the Employer on or after such date).
(c) Top-heavy vesting schedule. For any Top-Heavy Plan Year, the minimum top-heavy vesting schedule elected by the Employer
in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective Dates and Other Permitted Elections) will automatically apply to the
Plan. The minimum top-heavy vesting schedule applies to all benefits within the meaning of Code Â§411(a)(7) except those attributable
to Employee contributions, including benefits accrued before the effective date of Code Â§416 and benefits accrued before the Plan
became top-heavy. Further, no decrease in a Participant's Vested percentage shall occur in the event the Plan's status as top-heavy
changes for any Plan Year. However, this Subsection does not apply to the Account balances of any Employee who does not have an
Hour of Service after the Plan has initially become top-heavy and the Vested percentage of such Employee's Participant's Account
shall be determined without regard to this Section 6.4(c). Furthermore, pursuant to Code Â§416(i)(4), Participants whose employment is
governed by a collective bargaining agreement between the Employer and employee representatives under which retirement benefits
were the subject of good faith bargaining will not be subject to this Subsection unless otherwise provided in the collective bargaining
agreement and enumerated in the Adoption Agreement.
If in any subsequent Plan Year the Plan ceases to be a Top-Heavy Plan, then unless a specific Plan amendment is made to provide
otherwise, the Administrator will continue to use the vesting schedule in effect while the Plan was a Top-Heavy Plan.
(d) 100% vesting on partial or full Plan termination. Upon the complete discontinuance of the Employer's contributions to the
Plan (if this is a profit sharing plan) or upon any full or partial termination of the Plan, all amounts then credited to the Account of any
affected Participant shall become 100% Vested and shall not thereafter be subject to Forfeiture.
(e) No reduction in Vested percentage due to change in vesting schedule. If this is an amended or restated Plan, then
notwithstanding the vesting schedule specified in the Adoption Agreement, the Vested percentage of a Participant's Account shall not
be less than the Vested percentage attained as of the later of the Effective Date or adoption date of this amendment and restatement.
The computation of a Participant's nonforfeitable percentage of such Participant's interest in the Plan shall not be reduced as the result
of any direct or indirect amendment to this Article, or due to changes in the Plan's status as a Top-Heavy Plan. Furthermore, if the
Plan's vesting schedule is amended (including a change in the calculation of Years of Service or Periods or Service), then the amended
schedule will only apply to those Participants who complete an Hour of Service after the effective date of the amendment.
(f) Continuation of old schedule if 3 Years of Service. If the Plan's vesting schedule is amended, or if the Plan is amended in any
way that directly or indirectly affects the computation of the Participant's nonforfeitable percentage or if the Plan is deemed amended
by an automatic change to a top-heavy vesting schedule, then each Participant with at least three (3) Years of Service (or Periods of
Service if the elapsed time method is elected) as of the expiration date of the election period may elect to have such Participant's
nonforfeitable percentage computed under the Plan without regard to such amendment or change. If a Participant fails to make such
election, then such Participant shall be subject to the new vesting schedule. The Participant's election period shall commence on the
adoption date of the amendment, or deemed adoption date, and shall end sixty (60) days after the latest of:
(1) the adoption date, or deemed adoption date, of the amendment,
(2) the effective date of the amendment, or
(3) the date the Participant receives written notice of the amendment from the Employer or Administrator.

(g) Excludable service for vesting. In determining Years of Service or Periods of Service for purposes of vesting under the Plan,
Years of Service or Periods of Service shall be excluded as elected in the Adoption Agreement. For this purpose, a predecessor plan is
described in Regulation Â§1.411(a)-5(b)(3).
6.5 DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS
(a) Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity.
(1) Unless otherwise elected as provided below, a Participant who is married on the Annuity Starting Date and who does not die
before the Annuity Starting Date shall receive the value of all Plan benefits in the form of a Joint and Survivor Annuity. The Joint
and Survivor Annuity is an annuity that commences immediately and shall be equal in value to a single life annuity. Such joint
and survivor benefits following the Participant's death shall continue to the Spouse during the Spouse's lifetime at a rate equal to
either fifty percent (50%), seventy-five percent (75%) (or, sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) if the Insurer used to
provide the annuity does not offer a joint and seventy-five percent (75%) survivor annuity), or one hundred percent (100%) of the
rate at which such benefits were payable to the Participant. Unless otherwise elected in the Adoption Agreement, a joint and fifty
percent (50%) survivor annuity shall be considered the designated qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the normal form of
payment for the purposes of this Plan. However, the Participant may, without spousal consent, elect an alternative Joint and
Survivor Annuity, which alternative shall be equal in value to the designated qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity. An unmarried
Participant shall receive the value of such Participant's benefit in the form of a life annuity. Such unmarried Participant, however,
may elect to waive the life annuity. The election must comply with the provisions of this Section as if it were an election to waive
the Joint and Survivor Annuity by a married Participant, but without fulfilling the spousal consent requirement. The Participant
may elect to have any annuity provided for in this Section distributed upon the attainment of the "earliest retirement age" under
the Plan. The "earliest retirement age" is the earliest date on which, under the Plan, the Participant could elect to receive
retirement benefits.
(2) Any election to waive the Joint and Survivor Annuity must be made by the Participant in writing (or in such other form as
permitted by the IRS) during the election period and be consented to in writing (or in such other form as permitted by the IRS) by
the Participant's Spouse. If the Spouse is legally incompetent to give consent, the Spouse's legal guardian, even if such guardian
is the Participant, may give consent. Such election shall designate a Beneficiary (or a form of benefits) that may not be changed
without spousal consent (unless the consent of the Spouse expressly permits designations by the Participant without the
requirement of further consent by the Spouse). Such Spouse's consent shall be irrevocable and must acknowledge the effect of
such election and be witnessed by a Plan representative or a notary public. Such consent shall not be required if it is established
to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the required consent cannot be obtained because there is no Spouse, the Spouse
cannot be located, or other circumstances that may be prescribed by Regulations. The election made by the Participant and
consented to by such Participant's Spouse may be revoked by the Participant in writing (or in such other form as permitted by the
IRS) without the consent of the Spouse at any time during the election period. A revocation of a prior election shall cause the
Participant's benefits to be distributed as a Joint and Survivor Annuity. The number of revocations shall not be limited. Any new
election must comply with the requirements of this paragraph. A former Spouse's waiver shall not be binding on a new Spouse.
(3) The election period to waive the Joint and Survivor Annuity shall be the one-hundred eighty (180) day period ending on the
Annuity Starting Date.
(4) For purposes of this Section and Section 6.6, Spouse or surviving Spouse means the Spouse or surviving Spouse of the
Participant, provided that a former Spouse will be treated as the Spouse or surviving Spouse and a current Spouse will not be
treated as the Spouse or surviving Spouse to the extent provided under a "qualified domestic relations order" as described in Code
Â§414(p).
(5) With regard to the election, except as otherwise provided herein, the Administrator shall, in accordance with Regulation
Â§1.417(a)(3)-1, provide to the Participant no less than thirty (30) days and no more than one-hundred eighty (180) days before the
Annuity Starting Date a written (or such other form as permitted by the IRS) explanation of:
(i) the terms and conditions of the qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the "qualified optional survivor annuity" that
is payable in lieu of the qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity,
(ii) the Participant's right to make and the effect of an election to waive the Joint and Survivor Annuity,
(iii) the right of the Participant's Spouse to consent to any election to waive the Joint and Survivor Annuity, and
(iv) the right of the Participant to revoke such election, and the effect of such revocation.

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(6) Any distribution provided for in this Section may commence less than thirty (30) days after the notice required by Code
Â§417(a)(3) is given provided the following requirements are satisfied:
(i) the Administrator clearly informs the Participant that the Participant has a right to a period of thirty (30) days after
receiving the notice to consider whether to waive the Joint and Survivor Annuity and to elect (with spousal consent) a form
of distribution other than a Joint and Survivor Annuity;
(ii) the Participant is permitted to revoke any affirmative distribution election at least until the Annuity Starting Date or, if
later, at any time prior to the expiration of the seven (7) day period that begins the day after the explanation of the Joint and
Survivor Annuity is provided to the Participant;
(iii) the Annuity Starting Date is after the time that the explanation of the Joint and Survivor Annuity is provided to the
Participant. However, the Annuity Starting Date may be before the date that any affirmative distribution election is made by
the Participant and before the date that the distribution is permitted to commence under (iv) below; and
(iv) distribution in accordance with the affirmative distribution election does not commence before the expiration of the
seven (7) day period that begins the day after the explanation of the Joint and Survivor Annuity is provided to the
Participant.
(b) Alternative forms of distributions. In the event a married Participant duly elects pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) above not to
receive the benefit in the form of a Joint and Survivor Annuity, or if such Participant is not married, in the form of a life annuity, the
Administrator, pursuant to the election of the Participant, shall direct the distribution to a Participant or Beneficiary any amount to
which the Participant or Beneficiary is entitled under the Plan in one or more of the following methods which are permitted pursuant
to the Adoption Agreement.
(1) One lump-sum payment in cash or in property, provided that if a distribution of property is permitted, it shall be limited to
property that is specifically allocated and identifiable with respect to such Participant.
(2) Partial withdrawals.
(3) Payments over a period certain in monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual cash installments. The period over which such
payment is to be made shall not extend beyond the earlier of the Participant's life expectancy (or the joint life expectancy of the
Participant and the Participant's designated Beneficiary). Once payments have begun, a Participant may elect to accelerate the
payments (reduce the term and increase payments).
(4) Purchase of or providing an annuity. However, such annuity may not be in any form that will provide for payments over a
period extending beyond the life of the Participant (or the lives of the Participant and the Participant's designated Beneficiary) or
the life expectancy of the Participant (or the life expectancy of the Participant and the Participant's designated Beneficiary).
(c) Consent to distributions. Benefits may not be paid without the Participant's and the Participant's Spouse's consent if the present
value of the Participant's Joint and Survivor Annuity derived from Employer and Employee contributions exceeds $5,000 and the
benefit is "immediately distributable." However, spousal consent is not required if the distribution will be made in the form of a
qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the benefit is "immediately distributable." A benefit is "immediately distributable" if any part
of the benefit could be distributed to the Participant (or surviving Spouse) before the Participant attains (or would have attained if not
deceased) the later of the Participant's Normal Retirement Age or age 62.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the value of the Participant's benefit derived from Employer and Employee contributions does
not exceed $5,000, then the Administrator may only distribute such benefit in a lump-sum. No distribution may be made under the
preceding sentence after the Annuity Starting Date unless the Participant and the Participant's Spouse consent in writing (or in such
other form as permitted by the IRS) to such distribution. Any consent required under this paragraph must be obtained not more than
one-hundred eighty (180) days before commencement of the distribution and shall be made in a manner consistent with Section
6.5(a)(2).
For purposes of this Subsection, the Participant's benefit derived from Employer and Employee contributions shall not include:
(1) the Participant's Qualified Voluntary Employee Contribution Account, and (2) if selected in the Conditions for Distributions Upon
Severance of Employment Section of the Adoption Agreement, the Participant's Rollover Account.
(d) Obtaining consent. The following rules will apply with respect to the consent requirements set forth in Subsection (c):
(1) No consent shall be valid unless the Participant has received a general description of the material features and an
explanation of the relative values of the optional forms of benefit available under the Plan that would satisfy the notice
requirements of Code Â§417;
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers
43

[PAGE 49]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(2) The Participant must be informed of the right, if any, to defer receipt of the distribution and a description of the
consequences of failing to defer any distribution. If a Participant fails to consent, it shall be deemed an election to defer the
commencement of payment of any benefit. However, any election to defer the receipt of benefits shall not apply with respect to
distributions that are required under Section 6.8;
(3) Notice of the rights specified under this paragraph shall be provided no less than thirty (30) days and no more than
one-hundred eighty (180) days before the Annuity Starting Date;
(4) Written (or such other form as permitted by the IRS) consent of the Participant to the distribution must not be made before
the Participant receives the notice and must not be made more than one-hundred eighty (180) days before the Annuity Starting
Date; and
(5) No consent shall be valid if a significant detriment is imposed under the Plan on any Participant who does not consent to the
distribution.
(e) Required minimum distributions (Code Â§401(a)(9)). Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, the distribution
of a Participant's benefits, whether under the Plan or through the purchase of an annuity Contract, shall be made in accordance with
the requirements of Section 6.8.
(f) Annuity Contracts. All annuity Contracts under this Plan shall be non-transferable when distributed. Furthermore, the terms of
any annuity Contract purchased and distributed to a Participant or Spouse shall comply with all of the requirements of this Plan.
(g) TEFRA 242(b)(2) election. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to distributions made in accordance with Plan Section
6.8(a)(4).
(h) Distribution from partially Vested Account. If a distribution is made to a Participant who has not severed employment and
who is not fully Vested in the Participant's Account, and the Participant may increase the Vested percentage in such Account, then at
any relevant time the Participant's Vested portion of the Account will be equal to an amount ("X") determined by the formula: X = P
(AB plus D) minus D. For purposes of applying the formula: P is the Vested percentage at the relevant time, AB is the Account
balance at the relevant time, D is the amount of distribution, and the relevant time is the time at which, under the Plan, the Vested
percentage in the Account cannot increase.
(i) Qualified optional survivor annuity.
(1) Right to elect "qualified optional survivor annuity." Notwithstanding the preceding, effective with respect to Plan Years
beginning after December 31, 2007 and prior to the date this Plan is adopted, the Plan satisfied the "qualified optional survivor
annuity" provisions set forth in this Subsection. A Participant who elected to waive the qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity form
of benefit was entitled to elect the "qualified optional survivor annuity" at any time during the applicable election period.
Furthermore, the written explanation of the Joint and Survivor Annuity explains the terms and conditions of the "qualified
optional survivor annuity."
(2) Definition of "qualified optional survivor annuity."
(i) General. For purposes of this Article, the term "qualified optional survivor annuity" means an annuity:
(A) For the life of the Participant with a survivor annuity for the life of the Participant's Spouse which is equal to the
"applicable percentage" of the amount of the annuity which is payable during the joint lives of the Participant and the
Participant's Spouse, and
(B) Which is the actuarial equivalent of a single annuity for the life of the Participant.
Such term also includes any annuity in a form having the effect of an annuity described in the preceding sentence.
(ii) Applicable percentage. For purposes of this Subsection, the "applicable percentage" is based on the survivor annuity
percentage (i.e., the percentage which the survivor annuity under the Plan's qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity bears to the
annuity payable during the joint lives of the Participant and the Participant's Spouse). If the survivor annuity percentage is
less than seventy-five percent (75%), then the "applicable percentage" is seventy-five percent (75%); otherwise, the
"applicable percentage" is fifty percent (50%).

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(j) Source of distribution. If the Administrator does not set forth a distribution source order from which a partial distribution should
occur (e.g., pro rata from all Account sources) in the distribution form or some other administrative procedure, then the Participant or
Beneficiary may elect the Account source(s) from which the distribution should occur. This Subsection (j) does not apply to the extent
that a Participant or Beneficiary is required under the Plan terms to receive a distribution only from one or more specific Account(s)
source or where the Plan terms specifically provide other alternative rules.
6.6 DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS UPON DEATH
(a) Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity (QPSA). Unless otherwise elected as provided below, a Vested Participant who
dies before the Annuity Starting Date and who has a surviving Spouse shall have the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity paid to the
surviving Spouse. The Participant's Spouse may direct that payment of the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity commence within a
reasonable period after the Participant's death. If the Spouse does not so direct, payment of such benefit will commence at the time the
Participant would have attained the later of Normal Retirement Age or age 62. However, the Spouse may elect a later commencement
date. Any distribution to the Participant's Spouse shall be subject to the rules specified in Section 6.8.
(b) Election to waive QPSA. Any election to waive the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity before the Participant's death must be
made by the Participant in writing (or in such other form as permitted by the IRS) during the election period and shall require the
Spouse's irrevocable consent in the same manner provided for in Section 6.5(a)(2). Further, the Spouse's consent must acknowledge
the specific non-Spouse Beneficiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the non-Spouse Beneficiary need not be acknowledged, provided
the consent of the Spouse acknowledges that the Spouse has the right to limit consent only to a specific Beneficiary and that the
Spouse voluntarily elects to relinquish such right.
(c) Time to waive QPSA. The election period to waive the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity shall begin on the first day of the Plan
Year in which the Participant attains age 35 and end on the date of the Participant's death. An earlier waiver (with spousal consent)
may be made provided a written (or such other form as permitted by the IRS) explanation of the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity is
given to the Participant and such waiver becomes invalid at the beginning of the Plan Year in which the Participant turns age 35. In
the event a Participant separates from service prior to the beginning of the election period, the election period shall begin on the date
of such separation from service.
(d) QPSA notice. With regard to the election, the Administrator shall provide each Participant within the applicable election period,
with respect to such Participant (and consistent with Regulations), a written (or such other form as permitted by the IRS) explanation
of the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity containing comparable information to that required pursuant to Section 6.5(a)(5). For the
purposes of this paragraph, the term "applicable period" means, with respect to a Participant, whichever of the following periods ends
last:
(1) The period beginning with the first day of the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age 32 and ending with the close of
the Plan Year preceding the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age 35;
(2) A reasonable period after the individual becomes a Participant;
(3) A reasonable period ending after the Plan no longer fully subsidizes the cost of the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity with
respect to the Participant; or
(4) A reasonable period ending after Code Â§401(a)(11) applies to the Participant.
For purposes of applying this Subsection, a reasonable period ending after the enumerated events described in (2), (3) and (4) is
the end of the two (2) year period beginning one (1) year prior to the date the applicable event occurs and ending one (1) year after
that date. In the case of a Participant who separates from service before the Plan Year in which age 35 is attained, notice shall be
provided within the two (2) year period beginning one (1) year prior to separation and ending one (1) year after separation. If such a
Participant thereafter returns to employment with the Employer, the "applicable period" for such Participant shall be redetermined.
(e) Pre-REA. The Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity provided for in this Section shall apply only to Participants who are credited
with an Hour of Service on or after August 23, 1984. Participants who are not credited with an Hour of Service on or after
August 23, 1984, shall be provided with rights to the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity in accordance with Section 303(e)(2) of the
Retirement Equity Act of 1984.
(f) Consent. If the value of the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity (or the death benefit in the case of a Profit Sharing Plan or 401(k)
Plan that is not required to provide a Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity) derived from Employer and Employee contributions does not
exceed $5,000, the Administrator shall direct the distribution of such amount to the Participant's Spouse in a single lump-sum as soon
as practicable. No distribution may be made under the preceding sentence after the Annuity Starting Date unless the Spouse consents
in writing (or in such other form as permitted by the IRS). If the value exceeds $5,000, an immediate distribution of the entire amount
may be made to the surviving Spouse, provided such surviving Spouse consents in writing (or in such other form as permitted by the
IRS) to such distribution. Any consent required under this paragraph must be obtained not more than one-hundred eighty (180) days
before commencement of the distribution and shall be made in a manner consistent with Section 6.5(a)(2).

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(g) Alternative forms of distribution. Death benefits may be paid to a Participant's Beneficiary in one of the following optional
forms of benefits subject to the rules specified in Section 6.8 and the elections made in the Adoption Agreement. Such optional forms
of distributions may be elected by the Participant in the event there is an election to waive the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity, and
for any death benefits in excess of the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity. However, if no optional form of distribution was elected by
the Participant prior to death, then the Participant's Beneficiary may elect the form of distribution.
(1) One lump-sum payment in cash or in property that is allocated to the Accounts of the Participant at the time of the
distribution.
(2) Partial withdrawals.
(3) Payment in monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual cash installments over a period to be determined by the Participant or
the Participant's Beneficiary. In order to provide such installment payments, the Administrator may (A) segregate the aggregate
amount thereof in a separate, federally insured savings account, certificate of deposit in a bank or savings and loan association,
money market certificate or other liquid short-term security or (B) purchase a nontransferable annuity Contract for a term certain
(with no life contingencies) providing for such payment. After periodic installments commence, the Beneficiary shall have the
right to reduce the period over which such periodic installments shall be made, and the cash amount of such periodic installments
shall be adjusted accordingly.
(4) In the form of an annuity over the life expectancy of the Beneficiary.
(5) If death benefits in excess of the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity are to be paid to the surviving Spouse, such benefits may
be paid pursuant to (1), (2) or (3) above, or used to purchase an annuity so as to increase the payments made pursuant to the
Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity.
(h) Required minimum distributions (Code Â§401(a)(9)). Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, distributions
upon the death of a Participant shall comply with the requirements of Section 6.8.
(i) Payment to a child. For purposes of this Section, any amount paid to a child of the Participant will be treated as if it had been
paid to the surviving Spouse if the amount becomes payable to the surviving Spouse when the child reaches the age of majority.
(j) Voluntary Contribution Account. In the event that less than one hundred percent (100%) of a Participant's interest in the Plan is
distributed to such Participant's Spouse, the portion of the distribution attributable to the Participant's Voluntary Contribution Account
shall be in the same proportion that the Participant's Voluntary Contribution Account bears to the Participant's total interest in the
Plan.
(k) TEFRA 242(b)(2) election. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to distributions made in accordance with Section
6.8(a)(4).
6.7 TIME OF DISTRIBUTION
Except as limited by Section 6.8, whenever a distribution is to be made, or a series of payments are to commence, the distribution or
series of payments may be made or begun as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, unless a Participant
otherwise elects, payments of benefits under the Plan will begin not later than the sixtieth (60th) day after the close of the Plan Year in
which the latest of the following events occurs: (a) the date on which the Participant attains the earlier of age 65 or the Normal Retirement
Age specified herein; (b) the tenth (10th) anniversary of the year in which the Participant commenced participation in the Plan; or (c) the
date the Participant terminates service with the Employer. The failure of a Participant and, if applicable, the Participant's Spouse, to request
a distribution shall be deemed to be an election to defer the commencement of payment of any benefit until the time otherwise permitted
under the Plan.
6.8 REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS
(a) General rules
(1) Effective Date. Subject to the Joint and Survivor Annuity requirements set forth in Plan Section 6.5, the requirements of this
Section shall apply to any distribution of a Participant's interest in the Plan and will take precedence over any inconsistent
provisions of this Plan.
(2) Requirements of Treasury Regulations incorporated. All distributions required under this Section will be determined and
made in accordance with the Regulations under Code Â§401(a)(9) and the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of
Code Â§401(a)(9)(G).

[PAGE 52]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(3) Limits on distribution periods. As of the first "distribution calendar year," distributions to a Participant may only be made
in accordance with the selections made in the Form of Distributions Section of the Adoption Agreement. If such distributions are
not made in a single-sum, then they may only be made over one of the following periods: (i) the life of the Participant, (ii) the
joint lives of the Participant and a "designated Beneficiary," (iii) a period certain not extending beyond the "life expectancy" of
the Participant, or (iv) a period certain not extending beyond the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the Participant and a
"designated Beneficiary."
(4) TEFRA Section 242(b)(2) elections.
(i) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section, other than the Spouse's right of consent afforded under the Plan,
distributions may be made on behalf of any Participant, including a five percent (5%) owner, who has made a designation in
accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and in accordance with all of
the following requirements (regardless of when such distribution commences):
(A) The distribution by the Plan is one which would not have disqualified such Plan under Code Â§401(a)(9) as in
effect prior to amendment by the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984.
(B) The distribution is in accordance with a method of distribution designated by the Participant whose interest in the
Plan is being distributed or, if the Participant is deceased, by a Beneficiary of such Participant.
(C) Such designation was in writing, was signed by the Participant or the Beneficiary, and was made before January 1,
1984.
(D) The Participant had accrued a benefit under the Plan as of December 31, 1983.
(E) The method of distribution designated by the Participant or the Beneficiary specifies the time at which distribution
will commence, the period over which distributions will be made, and in the case of any distribution upon the
Participant's death, the Beneficiaries of the Participant listed in order of priority.
(ii) A distribution upon death will not be covered by the transitional rule of this Subsection unless the information in the
designation contains the required information described above with respect to the distributions to be made upon the death of
the Participant.
(iii) For any distribution which commences before January 1, 1984, but continues after December 31, 1983, the Participant,
or the Beneficiary, to whom such distribution is being made, will be presumed to have designated the method of distribution
under which the distribution is being made if the method of distribution was specified in writing and the distribution satisfies
the requirements in (i)(A) and (i)(E) of this Subsection.
(iv) If a designation is revoked, any subsequent distribution must satisfy the requirements of Code Â§401(a)(9) and the
Regulations thereunder. If a designation is revoked subsequent to the date distributions are required to begin, the Plan must
distribute by the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the revocation occurs the total amount not yet
distributed which would have been required to have been distributed to satisfy Code Â§401(a)(9) and the Regulations
thereunder, but for the Section 242(b)(2) election. For calendar years beginning after December 31, 1988, such distributions
must meet the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirements. Any changes in the designation will be considered to
be a revocation of the designation. However, the mere substitution or addition of another Beneficiary (one not named in the
designation) under the designation will not be considered to be a revocation of the designation, so long as such substitution
or addition does not alter the period over which distributions are to be made under the designation, directly or indirectly (for
example, by altering the relevant measuring life).
(v) In the case in which an amount is transferred or rolled over from one plan to another plan, the rules in Regulation
Â§1.401(a)(9)-8, Q&A-14 and Q&A-15, shall apply.
(b) Time and manner of distribution
(1) Required beginning date. The Participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the Participant
no later than the Participant's "required beginning date."
(2) Death of Participant before distributions begin. If the Participant dies before distributions begin, the Participant's entire
interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows as elected in the Distributions Upon Death Section
of the Adoption Agreement (or if no election is made, then the Beneficiary may elect either the lifetime method or the five-year
method and if the Beneficiary makes no election, the five-year method shall apply):
(i) Lifetime method (Spouse). If the Participant's surviving Spouse is the Participant's sole "designated Beneficiary,"
then, except as otherwise provided herein, distributions to the surviving Spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers

[PAGE 53]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in
which the Participant would have attained age 70 1/2, if later.
(ii) Lifetime method (non-Spouse). If the Participant's surviving Spouse is not the Participant's sole "designated
Beneficiary," then, except as provided in Section 6.8(b)(3) below, distributions to the "designated Beneficiary" will begin by
December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died.
(iii) Five-year method. If there is no "designated Beneficiary" as of September 30 of the year following the year of the
Participant's death or if otherwise elected pursuant to the Adoption Agreement with respect to a "designated Beneficiary,"
the Participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of
the Participant's death.
(iv) Death of Spouse. If the Participant's surviving Spouse is the Participant's sole "designated Beneficiary" and the
surviving Spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to the surviving Spouse begin, this Section 6.8(b)(2),
other than Section 6.8(b)(2)(i), will apply as if the surviving Spouse were the Participant.
For purposes of this Section 6.8(b)(2) and Section 6.8(b)(3), unless Section 6.8(b)(2)(iv) applies, distributions are considered
to begin on the Participant's "required beginning date." If Section 6.8(b)(2)(iv) applies, distributions are considered to begin on
the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving Spouse under Section 6.8(b)(2)(i). If distributions under an annuity
purchased from an insurance company irrevocably commence to the Participant before the Participant's "required beginning date"
(or to the Participant's surviving Spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving Spouse under Section
6.8(b)(2)(i)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.
(3) Forms of distribution. Unless the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance
company or in a single sum on or before the "required beginning date," as of the first "distribution calendar year" distributions
will be made in accordance with Sections 6.8(c) and 6.8(d) and only in a form of distribution provided in Section 6.5 or 6.6, as
applicable. If the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions
thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code Â§401(a)(9) and the Regulations thereunder.
(c) Required minimum distributions during Participant's lifetime
(1) Amount of required minimum distribution for each "distribution calendar year." During the Participant's lifetime, the
minimum amount that will be distributed for each "distribution calendar year" is the lesser of the following:
(i) the quotient obtained by dividing the "Participant's account balance" by the distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime
Table set forth in Regulation Â§1.401(a)(9)-9, using the Participant's age as of the Participant's birthday in the "distribution
calendar year"; or
(ii) if the Participant's sole "designated Beneficiary" for the "distribution calendar year" is the Participant's Spouse, the
quotient obtained by dividing the "Participant's account balance" by the number in the Joint and Last Survivor Table set
forth in Regulation Â§1.401(a)(9)-9, using the Participant's and Spouse's attained ages as of the Participant's and Spouse's
birthdays in the "distribution calendar year."
(2) Lifetime required minimum distributions continue through year of Participant's death. Required minimum
distributions will be determined under this Section 6.8(c) beginning with the first "distribution calendar year" and up to and
including the "distribution calendar year" that includes the Participant's date of death.
(d) Required minimum distributions after Participant's death
(1) Death on or after date distributions begin.
(i) Participant survived by "designated Beneficiary." If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and
there is a "designated Beneficiary," the minimum amount that will be distributed for each "distribution calendar year" after
the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the "Participant's account balance" by the longer of the
remaining "life expectancy" of the Participant or the remaining "life expectancy" of the Participant's "designated
Beneficiary," determined as follows:
(A) The Participant's remaining "life expectancy" is calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death,
reduced by one for each subsequent year.
(B) If the Participant's surviving Spouse is the Participant's sole "designated Beneficiary," the remaining "life
expectancy" of the surviving Spouse is calculated for each "distribution calendar year" after the year of the Participant's
death using the surviving Spouse's age as of the Spouse's birthday in that year. For "distribution calendar years" after
the year of the surviving Spouse's death, the remaining "life expectancy" of the surviving Spouse is calculated using the

age of the surviving Spouse as of the Spouse's birthday in the calendar year of the Spouse's death, reduced by one for
each subsequent calendar year.
(C) If the Participant's surviving Spouse is not the Participant's sole "designated Beneficiary," the "designated
Beneficiary's" remaining "life expectancy" is calculated using the age of the Beneficiary in the year following the year
of the Participant's death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
(ii) No "designated Beneficiary." If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is no "designated
Beneficiary" as of September 30 of the year after the year of the Participant's death, the minimum amount that will be
distributed for each "distribution calendar year" after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing
the "Participant's account balance" by the Participant's remaining "life expectancy" calculated using the age of the
Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
(2) Death before date distributions begin.
(i) Participant survived by "designated Beneficiary." Except as provided in Sections 6.8(b)(2) and 6.8(b)(3), if the
Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is a "designated Beneficiary," the minimum amount that will be
distributed for each "distribution calendar year" after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing
the "Participant's account balance" by the remaining "life expectancy" of the Participant's "designated Beneficiary,"
determined as provided in Section 6.8(d)(1).
(ii) No "designated Beneficiary." If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no "designated
Beneficiary" as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant's death, distribution of the Participant's
entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's
death.
(iii) Death of surviving Spouse before distributions to surviving Spouse are required to begin. If the Participant dies
before the date distributions begin, the Participant's surviving Spouse is the Participant's sole "designated Beneficiary," and
the surviving Spouse dies before distributions are required to begin to the surviving Spouse under Section 6.8(b)(2)(i), this
Section 6.8(d)(2) will apply as if the surviving Spouse were the Participant.
(e) Definitions. For purposes of this Section, the following definitions apply:
(1) "Designated Beneficiary" means the individual who is designated as the Beneficiary under the Plan and is the "designated
Beneficiary" under Code Â§401(a)(9) and Regulation Â§1.401(a)(9)-4.
(2) "Distribution calendar year" means a calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions
beginning before the Participant's death, the first "distribution calendar year" is the calendar year immediately preceding the
calendar year which contains the Participant's "required beginning date." For distributions beginning after the Participant's death,
the first "distribution calendar year" is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin under Section 6.8(b). The
required minimum distribution for the Participant's first "distribution calendar year" will be made on or before the Participant's
"required beginning date." The required minimum distribution for other "distribution calendar years," including the required
minimum distribution for the "distribution calendar year" in which the Participant's "required beginning date" occurs, will be
made on or before December 31 of that "distribution calendar year."
(3) "Life expectancy" means the life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in Regulation Â§1.401(a)(9)-9.
(4) "Participant's account balance" means the Participant's account balance as of the last Valuation Date in the calendar year
immediately preceding the "distribution calendar year" (valuation calendar year) increased by the amount of any contributions
made and allocated or Forfeitures allocated to the account balance as of the dates in the valuation calendar year after the
Valuation Date and decreased by distributions made in the valuation calendar year after the Valuation Date. For this purpose, the
Administrator may exclude contributions that are allocated to the account balance as of dates in the valuation calendar year after
the Valuation Date, but that are not actually made during the valuation calendar year. The account balance for the valuation
calendar year includes any amounts rolled over or transferred to the Plan either in the valuation calendar year or in the
"distribution calendar year" if distributed or transferred in the valuation calendar year.
(a) Reduction for QLACs. A Participantâs account balance is reduced by any QLACs (as defined below). This paragraph
applies only to QLACs purchased on or after July 2, 2014.
(b) Definition of QLAC. A QLAC is qualifying longevity annuity contract as defined in A-17 of Regulation Â§1.401(a)(9)-
6. Pursuant to such Regulation, a QLAC is an annuity contract that is purchased from an insurance company for a
Participant and that, in accordance with the rules of application of paragraph (c) below, satisfies each of the following
requirements:

[PAGE 55]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(1) The premiums paid with respect to the contract on a date do not exceed the lesser of the following amounts,
determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of A-17 of Regulation Â§1.401(a)(9)-6.
(a) An amount equal to the excess of $125,000 (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(2) of Aâ17 of
Regulation Â§1.401(a)(9)-6), over the sum of the premiums paid before that date with respect to
the contract, and the premiums paid on or before that date with respect to any other contract that
is intended to be a QLAC and that is purchased for the Participant under the Plan, or any other
plan, annuity, or account described in Code Â§401(a), 403(a), 403(b), or 408 or eligible
governmental plan under Â§457(b).
(b) An amount equal to the excess of 25% of the Participantâs account balance under the Plan
(including the value of any QLAC held under the Plan for the Participant) as of that date, over the
sum of the premiums paid before that date with respect to the contract, and the premiums paid on
or before that date with respect to any other contract that is intended to be a QLAC and that is
held or was purchased for the Participant under the Plan.
(2) The contract provides that distributions under the contract must commence not later than a specified
annuity starting date that is no later than the first day of the month next following the eighty-fifth (85th)
anniversary of the Employeeâs birth;
(3) The contract provides that, after distributions under the contract commence, those distributions must
satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) of A-17 of Regulation Â§1.401(a)(9)-6 (other than the requirement that
annuity payments commence on or before the required beginning date (RBD));
(4) The contract does not make available any commutation benefit, cash surrender right, or other similar
feature except as otherwise permitted under A-17 of Regulation Â§1.401(a)(9)-6;
(5) No benefits are provided under the contract after the death of the employee other than the benefits
described in paragraph (c) of A-17 of Regulation Â§1.401(a)(9)-6;
(6) Except as otherwise permitted under A-17 of Regulation Â§1.401(a)(9)-6, when the contract is issued, the
contract (or a rider or endorsement with respect to that contract) states that the contract is intended to be a
QLAC; and
(7) The contract is not a variable contract under Code Â§817, an indexed contract, or a similar contract, except to
the extent provided by the Commissioner in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal
Revenue Bulletin.
(c) Rules of application relating to premiums.
(1) Reliance on representations. For purposes of the limitation on premiums described in paragraphs (b)(1)
and (2) above, unless the Administrator has actual knowledge to the contrary, the Administrator may rely on an
Employeeâs representation (made in writing or such other form as may be prescribed by the Commissioner) of
the amount of the premiums described in such paragraphs, but only with respect to premiums that are not paid
under a plan, annuity, or contract that is maintained by the Employer or an entity that is treated as a single
employer with the Employer under Code Â§414(b), (c), (m), or (o).
(2) Consequences of excess premiums. If an annuity contract fails to be a QLAC solely because a
premium for the contract exceeds the limits under paragraph (b)(1)(a) above, then the contract is not a
QLAC beginning on the date that premium payment is made unless the excess premium is returned to the
non-QLAC portion of the Participantâs account in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of A-17 of
Regulation Â§1.401(a)(9)-6. If the contract fails to be a QLAC, then the value of the contract may not be
disregarded under paragraph (a) above as of the date on which the contract ceases to be a QLAC.
If the excess premium is returned (either in cash or in the form of a contract that is not intended to be a
QLAC) to the non-QLAC portion of the Participantâs account by the end of the calendar year following the
calendar year in which the excess premium was originally paid, then the contract will not be treated as
exceeding the limits under paragraph (b)(1)(a) above at any time, and the value of the contract will not be
included in the employeeâs account balance under paragraph (a) above. If the excess premium (including the
fair market value of an annuity contract that is not intended to be a QLAC, if applicable) is returned to the
non-QLAC portion of the Participantâs account after the last valuation date for the calendar year in which
the excess premium was originally paid, then the Participantâs account balance for that calendar year must
be increased to reflect that excess premium in the same manner as a Participantâs account balance is
increased under Regulation Â§1.401(a)(9)â7, Aâ2 to reflect a rollover received after the last valuation date.

[PAGE 56]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(3) Application of 25-percent limit. For purposes of the 25% limit under paragraph (b)(1)(b) above, a
Participantâs account balance on the date on which premiums for a contract are paid is the account balance as of
the last valuation date preceding the date of the premium payment, adjusted as follows. The account balance is
increased for contributions allocated to the account during the period that begins after the valuation date and ends
before the date the premium is paid and decreased for distributions made from the account during that period.
(d) Dollar and age limitations subject to adjustments. In the case of calendar years beginning on or after January 1,
2015, the $125,000 amount under paragraph (b)(1)(a) will be adjusted at the same time and in the same manner as the
limits are adjusted under Code Â§415(d), except that the base period shall be the calendar quarter beginning July 1, 2013,
and any increase under this paragraph that is not a multiple of $10,000 will be rounded to the next lowest multiple of
$10,000. The maximum age set forth in paragraph (b)(2) may be adjusted to reflect changes in mortality, with any such
adjusted age to be prescribed by the Commissioner in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal
Revenue Bulletin and made available by the Superintendent of Documents.
If a contract fails to be a QLAC because it does not satisfy the dollar limitation in paragraph (b)(1)(a) or the age limitation in
paragraph (b)(2), any subsequent adjustment that is made pursuant to this paragraph (d) will not cause the contract to
become a QLAC.
(5) "Required beginning date" means, except as otherwise elected in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective
Dates and Other Permitted Elections), with respect to any Participant, April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the
calendar year in which the Participant attains age 70 1/2 or the calendar year in which the Participant retires, except that benefit
distributions to a "5-percent owner" must commence by April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
Participant attains age 70 1/2.
(6) "5-percent owner" means a Participant who is a 5-percent owner as defined in Code Â§416 at any time during the Plan Year
ending with or within the calendar year in which such owner attains age 70 1/2. Once distributions have begun to a 5-percent
owner under this Section they must continue to be distributed, even if the Participant ceases to be a 5-percent owner in a
subsequent year.
6.9 DISTRIBUTION FOR MINOR OR INCOMPETENT INDIVIDUAL
If, in the opinion of the Administrator, a Participant or Beneficiary entitled to a distribution is not able to care for his or her affairs
because of a mental condition, a physical condition, or by reason of age in the case of a minor, then the Administrator shall direct the
distribution to the Participant's or Beneficiary's valid power of attorney, court appointed guardian, or any other person authorized under
state law to receive the benefit (including a custodian under a Uniform Transfers or Gifts to Minors Act), upon furnishing evidence of such
status satisfactory to the Administrator. The Administrator and the Trustee (or Insurer) do not have any liability with respect to payments so
made and neither the Administrator nor the Trustee (or Insurer) has any duty to make inquiry as to the competence of any person entitled to
receive payments under the Plan.
6.10 LOCATION OF PARTICIPANT OR BENEFICIARY UNKNOWN
In the event that all, or any portion, of the distribution payable to a Participant or Beneficiary hereunder shall, at the later of the
Participant's attainment of age 62 or Normal Retirement Age, remain unpaid solely by reason of the inability of the Administrator to
ascertain the whereabouts of such Participant or Beneficiary, the amount so distributable may, in the sole discretion of the Administrator,
either be treated as a Forfeiture or be paid directly to an individual retirement account described in Code Â§408(a) or an individual
retirement annuity described in Code Â§408(b). Before treating any Participant as being missing, the Administrator must conduct a
reasonable and diligent search for the Participant, using one or more of search methods the Plan Administrator determines are appropriate
under the circumstances, such as the methods suggested by DOL Field Assistance Bulletin 2014-01. Such search methods include:
(1) provide a distribution notice to the lost Participant at the Participant's last known address by certified or registered mail;
(2) check with the administrator of other employee benefit plans of the Employer that may have more up-to-date information
regarding the Participant's whereabouts;
(3) identify and contact the Participant's Designated Beneficiary;
(4) use one or more free internet search tools;
(5) attempt contact via email or telephone, or
(6) use proprietary internet search tools, commercial locator services, credit reporting agencies, information brokers, or other
search methods. Regarding search methods (2) and (3) above, if the Plan Administrator encounters privacy concerns, the Plan
Administrator may request that the Employer or other plan fiduciary (under (2)), or the Designated Beneficiary (under (3)),
contact the Participant or forward a letter requesting that the Participant contact the Plan Administrator.
In addition, if the Plan provides for mandatory distributions and the amount to be distributed to a Participant or Beneficiary does not
exceed $1,000, then the amount distributable may, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, either be treated as a Forfeiture, be paid
directly to an individual retirement account described in Code Â§408(a) or an individual retirement annuity described in Code Â§408(b), or

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
use the PBGC Missing Participant Program, or any successor program, at the time it is determined that the whereabouts of the Participant
or the Participant's Beneficiary cannot be ascertained. In the event a Participant or Beneficiary is located subsequent to the Forfeiture and
prior to the time the Plan has been terminated, such benefit shall be restored, first from Forfeitures, if any, and then from an additional
Employer contribution if necessary. Upon Plan termination, the portion of the distributable amount that is an "eligible rollover distribution"
as defined in Section 6.15(b)(1) may be paid directly to an individual retirement account described in Code Â§408(a) or an individual
retirement annuity described in Code Â§408(b). However, regardless of the preceding, a benefit that is lost by reason of escheat under
applicable state law is not treated as a Forfeiture for purposes of this Section nor as an impermissible forfeiture under the Code.
6.11 IN-SERVICE DISTRIBUTION
If elected in the Adoption Agreement, at such time as the conditions set forth in the Adoption Agreement have been satisfied, then the
Administrator, at the election of a Participant who has not severed employment with the Employer, shall direct the distribution of up to the
entire Vested amount then credited to the Accounts as elected in the Adoption Agreement maintained on behalf of such Participant. For
purposes of this Section, a Participant shall include an Employee who has an Account balance in the Plan. In the event that the
Administrator makes such a distribution, the Participant shall continue to be eligible to participate in the Plan on the same basis as any
other Employee. Any distribution made pursuant to this Section shall be made in a manner consistent with Section 6.5, including, but not
limited to, all notice and consent requirements of Code Â§Â§411(a)(11) and 417 and the Regulations thereunder. The Plan may, however,
make a partial distribution pursuant to this Section regardless of whether partial distributions are otherwise permitted pursuant to the
Adoption Agreement. Furthermore, if an in-service distribution is permitted from more than one account type, the Administrator may
determine any ordering of a Participant's in-service distribution from such accounts. The Administrator may adopt a policy imposing
frequency limitations or other reasonable administrative conditions on in-service distributions made pursuant to this Section.
6.12 DISTRIBUTION FOR HARDSHIP
(a) Hardship events. Except to the extent Section 12.10 applies, if elected in the Adoption Agreement, the Administrator, at the
election of the Participant, shall direct the distribution to any Participant in any one Plan Year up to an amount necessary to satisfy the
Participantâs immediate and heavy financial need, determined in accordance with the remaining provisions of this Section.
Distribution of Elective Deferrals (and any earnings credited to a participant's Elective Deferral and Qualified Matching and Qualified
Nonelective accounts as of the later of December 31, 1988, and or the end of the last Plan Year ending before July 1, 1989) may be
made to a Participant in the event of hardship. A hardship distribution may only be made on account of an immediate and heavy
financial need of the Participant and where the distribution is necessary to satisfy the immediate and heavy financial need. Such
distributions may also be made from those Accounts from which such distribution are authorized by the remaining provisions of this
Section. For purposes of this Section, a Participant shall include an Employee who has an Account balance in the Plan. Any
distribution made pursuant to this Section shall be deemed to be made as of the first day of the Plan Year or, if later, the Valuation
Date immediately preceding the date of distribution, and the Account from which the distribution is made shall be reduced
accordingly. Withdrawal under this Section shall be authorized only if the distribution is for an immediate and heavy financial need.
The Administrator will determine whether there is an immediate and heavy financial need based on the facts and circumstances. An
immediate and heavy financial need includes, but is not limited to, a distribution for one of the following:
(1) Expenses for (or necessary to obtain) medical care (as defined in Code Â§213(d));
(2) Costs directly related to the purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a principal residence for the Participant;
(3) Payments for burial or funeral expenses for the Participant's deceased parent, Spouse, children or dependents (as defined in
Code Â§152, and without regard to Code Â§152(d)(1)(B));
(4) Payment of tuition, related educational fees, and room and board expenses, for up to the next twelve (12) months of
post-secondary education for the Participant, the Participant's Spouse, children, or dependents (as defined in Code Â§152, and
without regard to Code Â§Â§152(b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B));
(5) Payments necessary to prevent the eviction of the Participant from the Participant's principal residence or foreclosure on the
mortgage on that residence; or
(6) Expenses for the repair of damage to the Participant's principal residence that would qualify for the casualty deduction under
Code Â§165 (determined without regard to whether the loss exceeds 10% of adjusted gross income).
(b) Beneficiary-based distribution. If elected in Adoption Agreement, then effective as of the date specified in the Adoption
Agreement, a Participant's hardship event includes an immediate and heavy financial need of the Participant's "primary Beneficiary
under the Plan," that would constitute a hardship event if it occurred with respect to the Participant's Spouse or dependent as defined
under Code Â§152 (such hardship events being limited to educational expenses, funeral expenses and certain medical expenses). For
purposes of this Section, a Participant's "primary Beneficiary under the Plan" is an individual who is named as a Beneficiary under the
Plan (by the Participant or pursuant to Section 6.2(d)) and has an unconditional right to all or a portion of the Participant's Account
balance under the Plan upon the Participant's death.

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(c) Other limits and conditions. If elected in the Adoption Agreement, no distribution shall be made pursuant to this Section from
the Participant's Account until such Account has become fully Vested. Furthermore, if a hardship distribution is permitted from more
than one Account, the Administrator may determine any ordering of a Participant's hardship distribution from such Accounts.
(d) Distribution rules apply. Any distribution made pursuant to this Section shall be made in a manner which is consistent with and
satisfies the provisions of Section 6.5, including, but not limited to, all notice and consent requirements of Code Â§Â§411(a)(11) and 417
and the Regulations thereunder.
6.13 SPECIAL RULE FOR CERTAIN PROFIT SHARING PLANS
(a) The provisions of this Section apply to a Participant in a Profit Sharing Plan or 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan to the extent elected in
the Adoption Agreement. However, unless otherwise permitted pursuant to Regulation Â§1.411(d)-4, this Section shall not apply with
respect to amounts that are transferred directly or indirectly (i.e., other than by a rollover) to this Plan from a defined benefit plan,
money purchase pension plan, target benefit plan, or stock bonus or profit sharing plan which is subject to the survivor annuity
requirements of Code Â§Â§401(a)(11) and 417.
(b) If an election is made to not offer life annuities as a form of distribution, then a Participant shall be prohibited from electing
benefits in the form of a life annuity and the Joint and Survivor Annuity provisions of Section 6.5 shall not apply.
(c) If an election is made to offer life annuities as a form of distribution but not as the normal form of distribution, then the Joint and
Survivor Annuity provisions of Section 6.5 shall not apply if a Participant does not elect an annuity form of distribution. Furthermore,
Subsection (e) shall not apply if a Participant elects an annuity form of distribution.
(d) Notwithstanding anything in Sections 6.2 and 6.6 to the contrary, upon the death of a Participant, the automatic form of
distribution will be a lump-sum rather than a Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity. Furthermore, the Participant's Spouse will
be the Beneficiary of the Participant's entire Vested interest in the Plan unless an election is made to waive the Spouse as Beneficiary.
The other provisions in Section 6.2 shall be applied by treating the death benefit in this Subsection as though it is a Pre-Retirement
Survivor Annuity.
(e) Except to the extent otherwise provided in this Section, the provisions of Sections 6.2 and 6.5 regarding spousal consent shall be
inoperative with respect to this Plan.
(f) If a distribution is one to which Code Â§Â§401(a)(11) and 417 do not apply, such distribution may commence less than thirty (30)
days after the notice required under Regulation Â§1.411(a)-11(c) is given, provided that:
(1) the Administrator clearly informs the Participant that the Participant has a right to a period of at least thirty (30) days after
the notice to consider the decision of whether or not to elect a distribution (and, if applicable, a particular distribution option), and
(2) the Participant, after receiving the notice, affirmatively elects a distribution.
6.14 QUALIFIED DOMESTIC RELATIONS ORDER DISTRIBUTION
All benefits provided to a Participant in this Plan shall be subject to the rights afforded to any Alternate Payee under a "qualified
domestic relations order." Furthermore, unless otherwise elected in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective Dates and
Other Permitted Elections), a distribution to an Alternate Payee shall be permitted if such distribution is authorized by a "qualified domestic
relations order," even if the affected Participant has not reached the "earliest retirement age." For the purposes of this Section, "qualified
domestic relations order" and "earliest retirement age" shall have the meanings set forth under Code Â§414(p).
A domestic relations order that otherwise satisfies the requirements for a "qualified domestic relations order" will not fail to be a
"qualified domestic relations order": (i) solely because the order is issued after, or revises, another domestic relations order or "qualified
domestic relations order"; or (ii) solely because of the time at which the order is issued, including issuance after the Annuity Starting Date
or after the Participant's death.
6.15 DIRECT ROLLOVERS
(a) Right to direct rollover. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a "distributee's"
election under this Section, a "distributee" may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Administrator, to have an
"eligible rollover distribution" paid directly to an "eligible retirement plan" specified by the "distributee" in a "direct rollover."
However, if less than the entire amount of the "eligible rollover distribution" is being paid directly to an "eligible retirement plan,"
then the Administrator may require that the amount paid directly to such plan be at least $500. Furthermore, the Administrator may
apply this Section by treating a Participant's Roth Elective Deferral Account separately from the Participant's other Accounts.

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(b) Definitions. For purposes of this Section, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) Eligible rollover distribution. An "eligible rollover distribution" means any distribution described in Code Â§402(c)(4) and
generally includes any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the "distributee," except that an "eligible
rollover distribution" does not include: (a) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not
less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the "distributee" or the joint lives (or joint life
expectancies) of the "distributee" and the "distributee's" "designated Beneficiary," or for a specified period of ten (10) years or
more; (b) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Code Â§401(a)(9); (c) any hardship distribution; (d) the
portion of any other distribution(s) that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities); (e) any loans that are treated as deemed distributions under Code
Â§72(p) which are not also an offset distribution; (f) dividends paid on employer securities described in Code Â§404(k); (g) the
costs of life insurance coverage (P.S. 58 costs); (h) prohibited allocations treated as deemed distributions under Code Â§409(p);
and (i) permissible withdrawals from a EACA described in Code Â§414(w); (k) any other distributions described in Regulation
Â§1.402(c)-2; and (j) any other distribution reasonably expected to total less than $200 during a year. For purposes of the $200
rule, a distribution from a designated Roth account and a distribution from other accounts under the Plan may be treated as made
under separate plans.
Notwithstanding the above, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an "eligible rollover distribution" merely because
the portion consists of after-tax voluntary Employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such
portion may be transferred only to:
(i) a traditional individual retirement account or annuity described in Code Â§408(a) or (b) (a "traditional IRA")
(ii) a Roth individual account or annuity described in Code Â§408A (a "Roth IRA"), or
(iii) a qualified defined contribution plan or an annuity contract described in Code Â§401(a) or Code Â§403(b), respectively,
that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the
portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so
includible.
(2) Eligible retirement plan. An "eligible retirement plan" is a "traditional IRA," a "Roth IRA," a qualified trust (an
employees' trust) described in Code Â§401(a) which is exempt from tax under Code Â§501(a), an annuity plan described in Code
Â§403(a), an eligible plan under Code Â§457(b) which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or
instrumentality of a state or political subdivision and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan
from this Plan, and an annuity contract described in Code Â§403(b), and for distributions made after December 18, 2015, a
SIMPLE IRA to the extent permitted under Code Â§408(p)(1)(B), that accepts the "distributee's" "eligible rollover distribution."
The definition of "eligible retirement plan" shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving Spouse, or to a Spouse or
former Spouse who is an Alternate Payee. If any portion of an "eligible rollover distribution" is attributable to payments or
distributions from a designated Roth account, an "eligible retirement plan" with respect to such portion shall include only another
designated Roth account of the individual from whose account the payments or distributions were made, or a Roth IRA of such
individual. A "direct rollover" of a distribution from a Roth Elective Deferral Account (other than an "in-Plan Roth rollover
contribution" (as defined in Section 12.11)) will only be made to another Roth Elective Deferral Account under an applicable
retirement plan described in Code Â§402A(e)(1) or to a Roth IRA described in Code Â§408A, and only to the extent that the
rollover is permitted under the rules of Code Â§402(c). In the case of a "distributee" who is a non-Spouse designated Beneficiary,
(i) the "direct rollover" may be made only to a traditional or Roth individual retirement account or an annuity described in Code
Â§408(b) ("IRA") that is established on behalf of the designated non-Spouse Beneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited
IRA pursuant to the provisions of Code Â§402(c)(11), and (ii) the determination of any required minimum distribution required
under Code Â§401(a)(9) that is ineligible for rollover shall be made in accordance with IRS Notice 2007-7, Q&A 17 and 18.
(3) Distributee. A "distributee" includes an Employee or Former Employee. In addition, the Employee's or Former Employee's
surviving Spouse and the Employee's or Former Employee's Spouse or former Spouse who is the Alternate Payee, are
"distributees" with regard to the interest of the Spouse or former Spouse.
(4) Direct rollover. A "direct rollover" is a payment by the Plan to the "eligible retirement plan" specified by the "distributee."
(c) Participant notice. A Participant entitled to an "eligible rollover distribution" must receive a written explanation of the right to a
"direct rollover," the tax consequences of not making a "direct rollover," and, if applicable, any available special income tax elections.
The notice must be provided within the same thirty (30) â one-hundred eighty (180) day timeframe applicable to the Participant
consent notice as set forth in Section 6.5(d)(3). The "direct rollover" notice must be provided to all Participants, unless the total
amount the Participant will receive as a distribution during the calendar year is expected to be less than $200.

(d) Non-Spouse Beneficiary rollover right. A non-Spouse Beneficiary who is a "designated Beneficiary" under Code Â§401(a)(9)(E)
and the Regulations thereunder, by a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer ("direct rollover"), may roll over all or any portion an "eligible
rollover distribution" to an IRA the Beneficiary establishes for purposes of receiving the distribution.
If the Participant's named Beneficiary is a trust, the Plan may make a direct rollover to an IRA on behalf of the trust, provided the trust
satisfies the requirements to be a "designated Beneficiary."
6.16 RESTRICTIONS ON DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS TRANSFERRED FROM A MONEY PURCHASE PLAN
Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, to the extent that any optional form of benefit under this Plan permits a
distribution prior to the Employee's retirement, death, Total and Permanent Disability, or severance from employment, and prior to Plan
termination, the optional form of benefit is not available with respect to benefits attributable to assets (including the post-transfer earnings
thereon) and liabilities that are transferred, within the meaning of Code Â§414(l), to this Plan from a money purchase pension plan qualified
under Code Â§401(a) (other than any portion of those assets and liabilities attributable to after-tax voluntary Employee contributions or to a
direct or indirect rollover contribution). Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, a Participant may not obtain an in-service
distribution with respect to such transferred amounts prior to the earlier of the Participant's Normal Retirement Age or attainment of age 62.
6.17 CORRECTIVE DISTRIBUTIONS
Nothing in this Article shall preclude the Administrator from making a distribution to a Participant, to the extent such distribution is
made to correct a qualification defect in accordance with the corrective procedures under the IRS' Employee Plans Compliance Resolution
System or any other voluntary compliance programs established by the IRS or the Department of Labor.
6.18 UNCASHED CHECKS
Subject to the provisions of Section 6.10, the Plan Administrator operationally may dispose of an uncashed distribution from the
Plan to a lost Participant at the time and in the manner described in this Section). Prior to doing so, the Plan Administrator must make
reasonable and diligent efforts to contact the lost Participant, including using such search methods the Plan Administrator determines are
appropriate under the circumstances. At the discretion of the Administrator, Plan distributions that remain uncashed, and which the
Administrator chooses not to reinvest in the Plan may be: (1) voluntarily remitted to a State unclaimed property department, but no sooner
than the appropriate state dormancy period has expired; or (2) deposited for the benefit of the lost Participant either to a: (a) bank account,
or (b) individual retirement account if the original distribution was an eligible rollover distribution.
For purposes of this Section 6.18, a distribution is âuncashed" if it remains uncashed by the "cash-by" date on the check or in an
accompanying notice, e.g., a date prescribed by the bank or the Plan. This "cash-by" date must be at least forty-five (45) days after the
check is issued. If there is no prescribed "cash-byâ date, then the amount is considered uncashed if it is not cashed by the checkâs stale date.
ARTICLE VII
TRUST, TRUSTEE AND CUSTODIAN
7.1 CONFLICT WITH PLAN
In the event of any conflicts between the provisions of this Plan and the Trust agreement, the provisions of this Plan control.
7.2 POWERS AND DUTIES OF CUSTODIAN
Subject to the terms of the Trust agreement, the Employer may appoint a Custodian of the Plan assets. The duties of the Custodian are
those set forth in the agreement with the Custodian. Any reference in the Plan to a Trustee also is a reference to a Custodian unless the
Employer has appointed a Custodian separate from the Trustee or the context of the Plan indicates otherwise.
7.3 LIFE INSURANCE
(a) Permitted insurance. To the extent not prohibited under the terms of the Trust agreement, the Trustee (or Insurer), in accordance
with nondiscriminatory operational procedures of the Administrator, shall ratably apply for, own, and pay all premiums on Contracts
on the lives of the Participants or, in the case of a Profit Sharing Plan (including a 401(k) Plan), on the life of a member of the
Participant's family or on the joint lives of a Participant and a member of the Participant's family. Furthermore, if a Contract is
purchased on the joint lives of the Participant and another person and such other person predeceases the Participant, then the Contract
may not be maintained under this Plan. Any initial or additional Contract purchased on behalf of a Participant shall have a face
amount of not less than $1,000, an amount set forth in the Administrator's procedures, or the limitation of the Insurer, whichever is
greater. If a life insurance Contract is to be purchased for a Participant, then the aggregate premium for ordinary life insurance for
each Participant must be less than 50% of the aggregate contributions and Forfeitures allocated to the Participant's Combined Account.
For purposes of this limitation, ordinary life insurance Contracts are Contracts with both non-decreasing death benefits and
non-increasing premiums. If term insurance or universal life insurance is purchased, then the aggregate premium must be 25% or less
of the aggregate contributions and Forfeitures allocated to the Participant's Combined Account. If both term insurance and ordinary
life insurance are purchased, then the premium for term insurance plus one-half of the premium for ordinary life insurance may not in
the aggregate exceed 25% of the aggregate Employer contributions and Forfeitures allocated to the Participant's Combined Account.

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
Notwithstanding the preceding, the limitations imposed herein with respect to the purchase of life insurance shall not apply, in the case
of a Profit Sharing Plan (including a 401(k) Plan), to the portion of the Participant's Account, other than the Participant's Elective
Deferral Account, Qualified Matching Account and Qualified Nonelective Contribution Account, that has accumulated for at least two
(2) Plan Years or to the entire Participant's Account if the Participant has been a Participant in the Plan for at least five (5) years. In
addition, amounts transferred to this Plan in accordance with Section 4.6(f)(1)(ii) or (iii) and a Participant's Voluntary Contribution
Account may be used to purchase Contracts without limitation. Thus, amounts that are not subject to the limitations contained herein
may be used to purchase life insurance on any person in whom a Participant has an insurable interest or on the joint lives of a
Participant and any person in whom the Participant has an insurable interest, and without regard to the amount of premiums paid to
purchase any life insurance hereunder.
(b) Contract conversion at retirement. Subject to the survivor annuity requirements of Sections 6.5 and 6.6 (if applicable), the
Administrator must direct the Trustee (or Insurer) to distribute the Contracts to the Participant or convert the entire value of the
Contracts at or before retirement into cash or provide for a periodic income so that no portion of such value may be used to continue
life insurance protection beyond the Participantâs actual retirement date.
(c) Limitations on purchase. Notwithstanding anything herein above to the contrary, amounts credited to a Participant's Qualified
Voluntary Employee Contribution Account pursuant to Section 4.9, shall not be applied to the purchase of life insurance Contracts.
Furthermore, no life insurance Contracts shall be required to be obtained on an individual's life if, for any reason (other than the
nonpayment of premiums) the Insurer will not issue a Contract on such individual's life.
(d) Proceeds payable to Plan. The Trustee (or Insurer) must be the owner of any life insurance Contract purchased under the terms
of this Plan. The Contract must provide that the proceeds will be payable to the Trustee (or Insurer); however, the Trustee (or Insurer)
shall be required to pay over all proceeds of the Contract to the Participant's "designated Beneficiary" in accordance with the
distribution provisions of Article VI as directed by the Administrator. A Participant's Spouse will be the "designated Beneficiary"
pursuant to Section 6.2, unless a qualified election has been made in accordance with Sections 6.5 and 6.6 of the Plan, if applicable.
Under no circumstances shall the Trust retain any part of the proceeds that are in excess of the cash surrender value immediately prior
to death. However, the Trustee (or Insurer) shall not pay the proceeds in a method that would violate the requirements of the
Retirement Equity Act of 1984, as stated in Article VI of the Plan, or Code Â§401(a)(9) and the Regulations thereunder. In the event of
any conflict between the terms of this Plan and the terms of any insurance Contract purchased hereunder, the Plan provisions shall
control.
(e) No responsibility for act of Insurer. The Employer, the Administrator and the Trustee shall not be responsible for the validity
of the provisions under a Contract issued hereunder or for the failure or refusal by the Insurer to provide benefits under such Contract.
The Employer, Administrator and the Trustee are also not responsible for any action or failure to act by the Insurer or any other person
which results in the delay of a payment under the Contract or which renders the Contract invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part.
7.4 LOANS TO PARTICIPANTS
(a) Permitted loans. To the extent not prohibited under the terms of the Trust agreement, the Administrator may, in the
Administrator's sole discretion, make loans to Participants or Beneficiaries. If loans are permitted, then the following shall apply:
(1) loans shall be made available to all Participants and Beneficiaries on a reasonably equivalent basis; (2) loans shall not be made
available to Highly Compensated Employees in an amount greater than the amount made available to other Participants; (3) loans
shall bear a reasonable rate of interest; (4) loans shall be adequately secured; and (5) loans shall provide for periodic repayment over a
reasonable period of time. Furthermore, no Participant loan shall exceed the Participant's Vested interest in the Plan. For purposes of
this Section, the term Participant shall include any Eligible Employee who is not yet a Participant, if, pursuant to the Adoption
Agreement, "rollovers" are permitted to be accepted from Eligible Employees.
(b) Spousal consent. If the Vested interest of a Participant is used to secure any loan made pursuant to this Section, then the written
(or such other form as permitted by the IRS) consent of the Participant's Spouse shall be required in a manner consistent with Section
6.5(a), provided the spousal consent requirements of such Section apply to the Plan. Such consent must be obtained within the
one-hundred eighty (180) day period prior to the date the loan is made. A new consent shall be required if the Vested interest of a
Participant is used for renegotiation, extension, renewal or other revision of the loan. However, unless the loan program established
pursuant to this Section provides otherwise, no spousal consent shall be required under this paragraph if the total interest subject to the
security is not in excess of $5,000. If a valid spousal consent has been obtained in accordance with this Subsection, then,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the portion of the Participant's Vested Account balance used as a security interest
held by the Plan by reason of a loan outstanding to the Participant shall be taken into account for purposes of determining the amount
of the Account balance payable at the time of death or distribution, but only if the reduction is used as repayment of the loan. If less
than 100% of the Participant's Vested Account balance (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) is payable to the
surviving Spouse, then the Account balance shall be adjusted by first reducing the Vested Account balance by the amount of the
security used as repayment of the loan, and then determining the benefit payable to the surviving Spouse.

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(c) Loan program. The Administrator shall be authorized to establish a Participant loan program to provide for loans under the
Plan. The loan program shall be established in accordance with Department of Labor Regulation Â§2550.408(b)-1(d)(2) providing for
loans by the Plan to parties-in-interest under said Plan, such as Participants or Beneficiaries. In order for the Administrator to
implement such loan program, a separate written document forming a part of this Plan must be adopted, which document shall
specifically include, but need not be limited to, the following:
(1) the identity of the person or positions authorized to administer the Participant loan program;
(2) a procedure for applying for loans;
(3) the basis on which loans will be approved or denied;
(4) limitations, if any, on the types and amounts of loans offered;
(5) the procedure under the program for determining a reasonable rate of interest;
(6) the types of collateral which may secure a Participant loan; and
(7) the events constituting default and the steps that will be taken to preserve Plan assets in the event such default.
(d) Loan default. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, if a Participant or Beneficiary defaults on a loan made
pursuant to this Section that is secured by the Participant's interest in the Plan, then a Participant's interest may be offset by the amount
subject to the security to the extent there is a distributable event permitted by the Code or Regulations. Notwithstanding anything in
the Planâs loan policy to the contrary, if a loan is accelerated due to a Participantâs termination of employment, then the Plan may
direct that the loan note be transferred or directly rolled over to another plan that will accept the transfer or rollover of the note.
(e) Loans subject to Plan terms. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, if this is an amendment and restatement
of an existing Plan, any loans made prior to the date this amendment and restatement is adopted shall be subject to the terms of the
Plan in effect at the time such loan was made.
7.5 AUDIT
(a) Duty to engage accountant. If an audit of the Plan's records shall be required by the Act and the regulations thereunder for any
Plan Year, the Administrator shall engage on behalf of all Participants an independent qualified public accountant for that purpose.
Such accountant shall, after an audit of the books and records of the Plan in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
within a reasonable period after the close of the Plan Year, furnish to the Administrator and the Trustee a report of the audit setting
forth the accountant's opinion as to whether any statements, schedules or lists, that are required by Act Â§103 or the Secretary of Labor
to be filed with the Plan's annual report, are presented fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied
consistently.
(b) Payment of fees. All auditing and accounting fees shall be an expense of and may, at the election of the Employer, be paid from
the Trust Fund.
(c) Information to be provided to Administrator. If some or all of the information necessary to enable the Administrator to
comply with Act Â§103 is maintained by a bank, insurance company, or similar institution, regulated, supervised, and subject to
periodic examination by a state or federal agency, then it shall transmit and certify the accuracy of that information to the
Administrator as provided in Act Â§103(b) within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of the Plan Year or such other date as
may be prescribed under regulations of the Secretary of Labor.
7.6 PLAN-TO-PLAN TRANSFERS
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Plan and to the extent not prohibited under the terms of the Trust agreement, the
Administrator may direct the Trustee to transfer the interest, if any, of a Participant to another trust forming part of a pension, profit
sharing, or stock bonus plan that meets the requirements of Code Â§401(a), provided that the trust to which such transfers are made permits
the transfer to be made and further provided that the terms of the transferee plan properly allocates the funds in each account to a transferee
account that preserves all the required features and restrictions applicable to such account under this Plan. However, the transfer of amounts
from this Plan to a nonqualified foreign trust is treated as a distribution and the transfer of assets and liabilities from this Plan to a plan that
satisfies Section 1165 of the Puerto Rico Code is also treated as distribution from the transferor plan.
7.7 EMPLOYER SECURITIES AND REAL PROPERTY
Subject to the provisions of Section 7.8 and to the extent not prohibited by the terms of the Trust agreement, the Plan permits the
Trustee to acquire and hold "qualifying employer securities" and "qualifying employer real property," as those terms are defined in the Act.
However, no more than one hundred percent (100%), in the case of a Profit Sharing Plan or 401(k) Plan, or ten percent (10%), in the case
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers
57

[PAGE 63]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
of a Money Purchase Plan, of the fair market value of all the assets in the Trust Fund may be invested in "qualifying employer securities"
and "qualifying employer real property."
Any such investment shall only be made upon written direction of the Employer who shall be solely responsible for the propriety of
such investment, except to the extent Participants direct the investment of their Accounts in such investment. Additional directives
regarding the purchase, sale, or retention of such securities may be addressed in a funding policy, statement of investment policy, or other
separate procedures or documents governing the investment of Plan assets.
Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Plan does not permit Participants to direct the investment of their Elective Deferral Accounts,
then the Trust Fund shall only be permitted to acquire or hold "qualifying employer securities" and "qualifying employer real property" to
the extent permitted under Act Â§407.
7.8 DIVESTMENT OF EMPLOYER SECURITIES
(a) Application of Section. This Section only applies to a Plan that is an "applicable defined contribution plan." Except as provided
herein or in Regulations, an "applicable defined contribution plan" means a defined contribution plan that holds employer securities
(within the meaning of Regulation Â§1.401(a)(35)-1(f)(3)) that are publicly traded (within the meaning of Regulation
Â§1.401(a)(35)-1(f)(5)). An "applicable defined contribution plan" does not include a one-participant plan, as defined in Code
Â§401(a)(35)(E)(iv) or an employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP") as defined in Code Â§4975(e)(7) if: (1) the ESOP holds no
contributions (or related earnings) that are (or were ever) subject to Code Â§Â§401(k) or 401(m); and (2) the ESOP is a separate plan, for
purposes of Code Â§414(l), from any other defined benefit plan or defined contribution plan maintained by the same employer or
employers. Except as provided in Regulation Â§1.401(a)(35)-1(f)(2)(iv) or in Code Â§401(a)(35)(F)(ii) (relating to certain controlled
groups), the Plan is treated as holding publicly traded Employer securities if any Employer corporation, or any member of a controlled
group of corporations which includes such Employer corporation (as defined in Code Â§401(a)(35)(F)(iii)) has issued a class of stock
which is a "publicly traded Employer security."
(b) Rule applicable to Elective Deferrals, Employee contributions and rollovers. If any portion of an "applicable individual's"
account attributable to Elective Deferrals, after-tax voluntary Employee contributions or rollover contributions is invested in
publicly-traded Employer securities, then, except as otherwise provided herein, the "applicable individual" may elect to direct the Plan
to divest any such securities, and to reinvest an equivalent amount in other investment options which satisfy the requirements of
Subsection (e). For purposes of this Section, an "applicable individual" means: (1) a Participant; (2) an Alternate Payee who has an
account under the Plan; or (3) a Beneficiary of a deceased Participant.
(c) Rule applicable to Employer contributions. If any portion of an "applicable individual's" account attributable to Employer
contributions (other than Elective Deferrals) is invested in publicly-traded Employer securities, then, except as otherwise provided
herein, the "applicable individual" may elect to direct the Plan to divest any such securities, and to reinvest an equivalent amount in
other investment options which satisfy the requirements of Subsection (d) below.
(1) Definition of "Applicable individual." For purposes of this Subsection, an "applicable individual" means: (i) a Participant
who has completed at least three (3) Years of Service; (ii) an Alternate Payee who has an account under the Plan with respect to a
Participant who has completed at least three (3) Years of Service; or (iii) a Beneficiary of a deceased Participant. For this
purpose, a Participant completes three (3) Years of Service on the last day of the vesting computation period provided for under
the Plan that constitutes the completion of the third year of service under Code Â§411(a)(5). However, if the Plan uses the elapsed
time method of crediting service for vesting purposes (or the Plan provides for immediate vesting without using a vesting
computation period or the elapsed time method of determining vesting), a Participant completes three (3) years of service on the
day immediately preceding the third anniversary of the Participant's date of hire.
(2) Definition of "publicly traded Employer security." For purposes of this Section, a "publicly traded Employer security"
means a security which is traded on a national securities exchange that is registered under Section 6 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1935 or which is traded on a foreign national securities exchange that is officially recognized, sanctioned, or supervised by
a governmental authority and the security is deemed by the securities and Exchange commission as having a "ready market"
under SEC Rule 14c3-1 (17 CFR 240.15c3). In addition, if the Employer, or any member of a controlled group of corporations
(as described in Regulation Â§1.401(a)(35)-1(f)(2)(iv)(A) which includes the Employer, has issued a class of stock which is a
publicly traded employer security, and the Plan hold employer securities which are not publicly traded Employer securities, then
the Plan shall be treated as holding publicly traded Employer securities.
(d) Investment options. For purposes of this Section, other investment options must include not less than three (3) investment
options, other than Employer securities, to which the individual who the right to divest under Subsections (c) or (d) may direct the
proceeds from the divestment of Employer securities. Each of the three (3) investment options must be diversified and have materially
different risk and return characteristics. For this purpose, investment options that constitute a broad range of investment alternatives
within the meaning of Department of Labor Regulation Â§2550.404câ1(b)(3) are treated as being diversified and having materially
different risk and return characteristics.

(e) Restrictions or conditions on investments in Employer securities. The Plan must provide reasonable divestment and
reinvestment opportunities at least quarterly. Furthermore, except as permitted by Regulation Â§1.401(a)(35)-1(e), the Plan may not
impose restrictions or conditions on the investment of Employer securities which the Plan does not impose on the investment of other
Plan assets.
ARTICLE VIII
AMENDMENT, TERMINATION AND MERGERS
8.1 AMENDMENT
(a) General rule on Employer amendment. The Employer shall have the right at any time to amend this Plan subject to the
limitations of this Section. However, any amendment that affects the rights, duties or responsibilities of the Trustee (or Insurer) or
Administrator may only be made with the Trustee's (or Insurer's) or Administrator's consent. Any such amendment shall become
effective as provided therein upon its execution. The Trustee (or Insurer) shall not be required to execute any such amendment unless
the amendment affects the duties of the Trustee (or Insurer) hereunder.
(b) Permissible amendments. The Employer may amend the Plan to accomplish any of the following items without affecting
reliance on the opinion letter: (1) change the choice of options in the Adoption Agreement or Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement
(Special Effective Dates and Other Permitted Elections) , (2) add certain sample or model amendments published by the Internal
Revenue Service or other required good-faith amendments where the IRS has provided that their adoption will not cause the Plan to be
treated as an individually designed plan, (3) add a list of any "Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits" which must be preserved, (4)
adjust the limitations under Code Â§Â§415, 402(g), 401(a)(17) and 414(q)(1)(B) to reflect annual cost-of-living increases, and (5) change
the pre-approved plan Providerâs name. An Employer that amends the Plan for any other reason, including a waiver of the minimum
funding requirement under Code Â§412(c), will no longer participate in this pre-approved plan and this Plan will be considered to be an
individually designed plan for purposes of reliance. A Plan amendment does not include an amendment or substitution of the Trust.
(c) Provider amendments. The Employer (and every Participating Employer) expressly delegates authority to the Provider, the
right to amend the Plan by submitting a copy of the amendment to each Employer (and Participating Employer) who has adopted this
preapproved plan, after first having received a ruling or favorable determination from the Internal Revenue Service that the
preapproved plan as amended qualifies under Code Â§401(a) (unless a ruling or determination is not required by the IRS). The
Provider, as defined in section 4.08 of Rev. Proc. 2017-41, may amend any part of the Plan. However, for purposes of reliance on an
Opinion Letter, the Provider will no longer have the authority to amend the Plan on behalf of the Employer as of the date (1) the
Employer amends the plan to incorporate a type of Plan described in section 6.03 of Rev. Proc. 2017-41 that is not permitted under the
Pre-approved Plan program, or (2) the Internal Revenue Service notifies the Employer, in accordance with section 8.06(3) of Rev.
Proc. 2017-41, that the Plan is an individually designed plan due to the nature and extent of Employer amendments to the Plan. For
purposes of Provider amendments, the mass submitter shall be recognized as the agent of the Provider. If the Provider does not adopt
the amendments made by the mass submitter, it will no longer be identical to or a minor modifier of the mass submitter plan.
The mass submitter reserves the right to amend the Plan Documents from time to time in accordance with this Section 8.1(c).
(d) Impermissible amendments. No amendment to the Plan shall be effective if it authorizes or permits any part of the Trust Fund
(other than such part as is required to pay taxes and administration expenses) to be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for
the exclusive benefit of the Participants or their Beneficiaries or estates; or causes any reduction in the amount credited to the account
of any Participant; or causes or permits any portion of the Trust Fund to revert to or become property of the Employer.
(e) Anti-cutback restrictions. No Plan amendment or transaction having the effect of a Plan amendment (such as a merger, plan
transfer or similar transaction) shall be effective if it eliminates or reduces any "Section 411(d)(6) protected benefit" or adds or
modifies conditions relating to "Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits" which results in a further restriction on such benefits (even if the
amendment merely adds a restriction or condition that is permitted under the vesting rules in Code Â§Â§411(a)(3) â (11)) unless such
"Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits" are preserved in operation with respect to benefits accrued as of the later of the adoption date or
effective date of the amendment. Notwithstanding the preceding, "Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits" may be eliminated or reduced
to the extent permitted by Code Â§412(d)(2) or Regulations (including Regulation Â§Â§1.411(d)-3 and 1.411(d)-4) or other IRS guidance.
For purposes of this Subsection, a plan amendment which has the effect of decreasing a Participant's "Section 411(d)(6) protected
benefits" with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing a "Section 411(d)(6)
protected benefit." "Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits" are benefits described in Code Â§411(d)(6)(A), early retirement benefits and
retirement-type subsidies, and optional forms of benefit. The preceding shall not apply to a Plan amendment that eliminates or restricts
the ability of a Participant to receive payment of his or her Account under a particular optional form of benefit if the amendment
provides a single-sum distribution form that is otherwise identical to the optional form of benefit being eliminated or restricted. For
this purpose, a single-sum distribution form is otherwise identical only if the single-sum distribution form is identical in all respects to
the eliminated or restricted optional form of benefit (or would be identical except that it provides greater rights to the Participant)
except with respect to the timing of payments after commencement.

8.2 TERMINATION
(a) Termination of Plan. The Employer shall have the right at any time to terminate the Plan by delivering to the Trustee (or
Insurer) and Administrator written notice of such termination. The Employer has no obligation or liability whatsoever to maintain the
Plan for any specific length of time and may terminate the Plan or discontinue contributions under the Plan at any time without
liability hereunder for any such discontinuance. Upon any full or partial termination or upon the complete discontinuance of the
Employer's Contributions to the Plan (in the case of a Profit Sharing Plan), all amounts credited to the affected Participants' Combined
Accounts shall become 100% Vested and shall not thereafter be subject to Forfeiture.
(b) Distribution of assets. Upon the full termination of the Plan, the Employer shall direct the distribution of the assets to
Participants in a manner that is consistent with and satisfies the provisions of Section 6.5, except that no Participant or spousal consent
is required. Distributions to a Participant shall be made in cash (or in property if permitted in the Adoption Agreement) or through the
purchase of irrevocable nontransferable deferred commitments from the Insurer. Except as permitted by Regulations, the termination
of the Plan shall not result in the reduction of "Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits" as described in Section 8.1(e). In addition, to the
extent Section 6.13 (Special Rule for Certain Profit Sharing Plans) could apply to all or a portion of the assets, then, subject to Section
12.2, the Administrator will direct the distribution of assets to Participants in a lump-sum distribution. Such distribution will be made
as soon as reasonable after the Plan termination, regardless of: (1) the amount of the Participant's Vested Account balance; (2) the
Participant's age; and (3) whether the Participant consents to the distribution. Furthermore, to the extent a distribution is required to be
made pursuant to this Section and the Participant does not consent to such distribution, then the Administrator may make a direct
distribution to an individual retirement account described in Code Â§408(a) or an individual retirement annuity described in Code
Â§408(b).
(c) Abandoned plan. If the Employer, in accordance with DOL guidance, abandons the Plan, then the Trustee (or Insurer) or other
party permitted to take action as a qualified terminal administrator (QTA), may terminate the Plan in accordance with applicable DOL
and IRS regulations and other guidance.
8.3 MERGER, CONSOLIDATION OR TRANSFER OF ASSETS
This Plan may be merged or consolidated with, or its assets and/or liabilities may be transferred to, any other plan provided the
benefits which would be received by a Participant of this Plan, in the event of a termination of the plan immediately after such transfer,
merger or consolidation, are at least equal to the benefits the Participant would have received if the Plan had terminated immediately before
the transfer, merger or consolidation and such transfer, merger or consolidation does not otherwise result in the elimination or reduction of
any "Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits" as described in Section 8.1(e).
ARTICLE IX
TOP-HEAVY PROVISIONS
9.1 TOP-HEAVY PLAN REQUIREMENTS
Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, for any Top-Heavy Plan Year, the Plan shall provide the special vesting
requirements of Code Â§416(b) pursuant to Section 6.4 of the Plan and the special minimum allocation requirements of Code Â§416(c)
pursuant to Section 4.3(f) of the Plan. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the minimum allocation shall be an Employer Nonelective
Contribution and, if no vesting schedule has been selected in the Adoption Agreement or the selection is invalid, shall be subject to the 6
Year Graded vesting schedule described in the Adoption Agreement.
Notwithstanding the above, the Top-Heavy Plan Year requirements of this Article and Code Â§416 shall not apply in any Plan Year in
which the Plan consists solely of a cash or deferred arrangement which meets the requirements of Code Â§401(k)(12) or Â§401(k)(13) and
matching contributions meet the requirements of Code Â§401(m)(11) or Â§401(m)(12).
9.2 DETERMINATION OF TOP-HEAVY STATUS
(a) Definition of Top-Heavy Plan. This Plan shall be a Top-Heavy Plan if any of the following conditions exists:
(1) if the "top-heavy ratio" for this Plan exceeds sixty percent (60%) and this Plan is not part of any "required aggregation
group" or "permissive aggregation group";
(2) if this Plan is a part of a "required aggregation group" but not part of a "permissive aggregation group" and the "top-heavy
ratio" for the group of plans exceeds sixty percent (60%); or
(3) if this Plan is a part of a "required aggregation group" and part of a "permissive aggregation group" and the "top-heavy
ratio" for the "permissive aggregation group" exceeds sixty percent (60%).

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(b) Top-heavy ratio. "Top-heavy ratio" means, with respect to a "determination date":
(1) If the Employer maintains one or more defined contribution plans (including any simplified employee pension plan (as
defined in Code Â§408(k))) and the Employer has not maintained any defined benefit plan which during the 5-year period ending
on the "determination date" has or has had accrued benefits, the top-heavy ratio for this Plan alone or for the "required
aggregation group" or "permissive aggregation group" as appropriate is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the
account balances of all Key Employees as of the "determination date" (including any part of any Account balance distributed in
the 1-year period ending on the "determination date") (5-year period ending on the "determination date" in the case of a
distribution made for a reason other than severance from employment, death or Total and Permanent Disability), and the
denominator of which is the sum of all Account balances (including any part of any Account balance distributed in the 1-year
period ending on the "determination date") (5-year period ending on the "determination date" in the case of a distribution made
for a reason other than severance from employment, death or Total and Permanent Disability), both computed in accordance with
Code Â§416 and the Regulations thereunder.
Both the numerator and denominator of the top-heavy ratio are increased to reflect any contribution not actually made as of
the "determination date," but which is required to be taken into account on that date under Code Â§416 and the Regulations
thereunder.
(2) If the Employer maintains one or more defined contribution plans (including any simplified employee pension plan) and the
Employer maintains or has maintained one or more defined benefit plans which during the 5-year period ending on the
"determination date" has or has had any accrued benefits, the top-heavy ratio for any "required aggregation group" or "permissive
aggregation group" as appropriate is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of account balances under the aggregated
defined contribution plan or plans for all Key Employees, determined in accordance with (1) above, and the "present value" of
accrued benefits under the aggregated defined benefit plan or plans for all Key Employees as of the "determination date," and the
denominator of which is the sum of the account balances under the aggregated defined contribution plan or plans for all
participants, determined in accordance with (1) above, and the "present value" of accrued benefits under the defined benefit plan
or plans for all participants as of the "determination date," all determined in accordance with Code Â§416 and the Regulations
thereunder. The accrued benefits under a defined benefit plan in both the numerator and denominator of the top-heavy ratio are
increased for any distribution of an accrued benefit made in the 1-year period ending on the "determination date" (5-year period
ending on the "determination date" in the case of a distribution made for a reason other than severance from employment, death
or Total and Permanent Disability).
(3) For purposes of (1) and (2) above, the value of Account balances and the "present value" of accrued benefits will be
determined as of the most recent Valuation Date that falls within or ends with the 12-month period ending on the "determination
date," except as provided in Code Â§416 and the Regulations thereunder for the first and second plan years of a defined benefit
plan. The Account balances and accrued benefits of a Participant (i) who is not a Key Employee but who was a Key Employee in
a prior year, or (ii) who has not been credited with at least one Hour of Service with any Employer maintaining the Plan at any
time during the 1-year period ending on the "determination date" will be disregarded. The calculation of the top-heavy ratio, and
the extent to which distributions, rollovers, and transfers are taken into account will be made in accordance with Code Â§416 and
the Regulations thereunder. Deductible Employee contributions will not be taken into account for purposes of computing the
top-heavy ratio. When aggregating plans the value of Account balances and accrued benefits will be calculated with reference to
the "determination dates" that fall within the same calendar year.
The accrued benefit of a participant other than a Key Employee shall be determined under (i) the method, if any, that
uniformly applies for accrual purposes under all defined benefit plans maintained by the Employer, or (ii) if there is no such
method, as if such benefit accrued not more rapidly than the slowest accrual rate permitted under the fractional rule of Code
Â§411(b)(1)(C).
(c) Determination date. "Determination date" means, for any Plan Year subsequent to the first Plan Year, the last day of the
preceding Plan Year. For the first Plan Year of the Plan, "determination date" means the last day of that Plan Year.
(d) Permissive aggregation group. "Permissive aggregation group" means the "required aggregation group" of plans plus any other
plan or plans of the Employer or any Affiliated Employer which, when considered as a group with the "required aggregation group,"
would continue to satisfy the requirements of Code Â§Â§401(a)(4) and 410.
(e) Present value. "Present value" means the present value based only on the interest and mortality rates specified in Appendix A to
the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective Dates and Other Permitted Elections).
(f) Required aggregation group. "Required aggregation group" means: (1) each qualified plan of the Employer or any Affiliated
Employer in which at least one Key Employee participates or participated at any time during the Plan Year containing the
"determination date" or any of the four preceding Plan Years (regardless of whether the plan has terminated), and (2) any other
qualified plan of the Employer or any Affiliated Employer which enables a plan described in (l) to meet the requirements of Code
Â§401(a)(4) or 410.

(g) Valuation Date. Valuation Date means the date elected by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement as of which Account
balances or accrued benefits are valued for purposes of calculating the "top-heavy ratio."

MISCELLANEOUS
10.1 EMPLOYER ADOPTIONS
(a) Method of adoption. Any organization may become the Employer hereunder by executing the Adoption Agreement.
(b) Separate affiliation. Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, the affiliation of the Employer and the participation of its
Participants shall be separate and apart from that of any other employer and its participants hereunder.
10.2 PARTICIPANT'S RIGHTS
This Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract between the Employer and any Participant or to be a consideration or an
inducement for the employment of any Participant or Employee. Nothing contained in this Plan shall be deemed to give any Participant or
Employee the right to be retained in the service of the Employer or to interfere with the right of the Employer to discharge any Participant
or Employee at any time regardless of the effect which such discharge shall have upon the Employee as a Participant of this Plan.
10.3 ALIENATION
(a) General rule. Subject to the exceptions provided below and as otherwise permitted by the Code and the Act, no benefit which
shall be payable to any person (including a Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary) shall be subject in any manner to anticipation,
alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or charge, and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign,
pledge, encumber, or charge the same shall be void; and no such benefit shall in any manner be liable for, or subject to, the debts,
contracts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of any such person, nor shall it be subject to attachment or legal process for or against such
person, and the same shall not be recognized except to such extent as may be required by law.
(b) Exception for loans. Subsection (a) shall not apply to the extent a Participant or Beneficiary is indebted to the Plan by reason of
a loan made pursuant to Section 7.4. At the time a distribution is to be made to or for a Participant's or Beneficiary's benefit, such
portion of the amount to be distributed as shall equal such indebtedness shall be paid to the Plan, to apply against or discharge such
indebtedness. Prior to making a payment, however, the Participant or Beneficiary must be given notice by the Administrator that such
indebtedness is to be so paid in whole or part from the Participant's interest in the Plan. If the Participant or Beneficiary does not agree
that the indebtedness is a valid claim against the Participant's interest in the Plan, the Participant or Beneficiary shall be entitled to a
review of the validity of the claim in accordance with procedures provided in Section 2.10.
(c) Exception for QDRO. Subsection (a) shall not apply to a "qualified domestic relations order" defined in Code Â§414(p), and
those other domestic relations orders permitted to be so treated by the Administrator under the provisions of the Retirement Equity Act
of 1984. The Administrator shall establish a written procedure to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and to
administer distributions under such qualified orders. Further, to the extent provided under a "qualified domestic relations order," a
former Spouse of a Participant shall be treated as the Spouse or surviving Spouse for all purposes under the Plan.
(d) Exception for certain debts to Plan. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section to the contrary, an offset to a Participant's
accrued benefit against an amount that the Participant is ordered or required to pay the Plan with respect to a judgment, order, or
decree issued, or a settlement entered into, on or after August 5, 1997, shall be permitted in accordance with Code Â§Â§401(a)(13)(C)
and (D).
10.4 PLAN COMMUNICATIONS, INTERPRETATION AND CONSTRUCTION
(a) Applicable law. This Plan shall be construed and enforced according to the Code, the Act and the laws of the state or
commonwealth in which the Employer's principal office is located (unless otherwise designated in Appendix A to the Adoption
Agreement (Special Effective Dates and Other Permitted Elections)), other than its laws respecting choice of law, to the extent not
pre-empted by federal law.
(b) Administrator's discretion/nondiscriminatory administration. The Administrator has total and complete discretion to
interpret and construe the Plan and to determine all questions arising in the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan.
Any determination the Administrator makes under the Plan is final and binding upon any affected person. The Administrator must
exercise all of its Plan powers and discretion, and perform all of its duties, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner.
(c) Communications. All Participant or Beneficiary notices, designations, elections, consents or waivers must be made in a form the
Administrator (or, as applicable, the Trustee or Insurer) specifies or otherwise approves. Any person entitled to notice under the Plan
may waive the notice or shorten the notice period unless such actions are contrary to applicable law.

(d) Evidence. Anyone, including the Employer, required to give data, statements or other information relevant under the terms of the
Plan ("evidence") may do so by certificate, affidavit, document or other form which the person to act in reliance may consider
pertinent, reliable and genuine, and to have been signed, made or presented by the proper party or parties. The Administrator, Trustee
and Insurer are protected fully in acting and relying upon any evidence described under the immediately preceding sentence.
(e) Plan terms binding. The Plan is binding upon all parties, including but not limited to, the Employer, Trustee, Insurer,
Administrator, Participants and Beneficiaries.
(f) Parties to litigation. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, a Participant or a Beneficiary is not a necessary party or
required to receive notice of process in any court proceeding involving the Plan, the Trust or any Fiduciary. Any final judgment (not
subject to further appeal) entered in any such proceeding will be binding upon all parties, including the Employer, the Administrator,
Trustee, Insurer, Participants and Beneficiaries.
(g) Fiduciaries not insurers. The Trustee, Administrator and the Employer in no way guarantee the Plan assets from loss or
depreciation. The Employer does not guarantee the payment of any money which may be or becomes due to any person from the Plan.
The liability of the Employer, the Administrator and the Trustee to make any distribution from the Trust at any time and all times is
limited to the then available assets of the Trust.
(h) Construction/severability. The Plan, the Adoption Agreement, the Trust and all other documents to which they refer, will be
interpreted consistent with and to preserve tax qualification of the Plan under Code Â§401(a) and tax exemption of the Trust under
Code Â§501(a) and also consistent with the Act and other applicable law. To the extent permissible under applicable law, any provision
which a court (or other entity with binding authority to interpret the Plan) determines to be inconsistent with such construction and
interpretation, is deemed severed and is of no force or effect, and the remaining Plan terms will remain in full force and effect.
(i) Uniformity. All provisions of this Plan shall be interpreted and applied in a uniform, nondiscriminatory manner.
(j) Headings. The headings and subheadings of this Plan have been inserted for convenience of reference and are to be ignored in
any construction of the provisions hereof.
10.5 GENDER, NUMBER AND TENSE
Wherever any words are used herein in the masculine, feminine or neuter gender, they shall be construed as though they were also
used in another gender in all cases where they would so apply; whenever any words are used herein in the singular or plural form, they
shall be construed as though they were also used in the other form in all cases where they would so apply; and whenever any words are
used herein in the past or present tense, they shall be construed as though they were also used in the other form in all cases where they
would so apply.
10.6 LEGAL ACTION
In the event any claim, suit, or proceeding is brought regarding the Trust and/or Plan established hereunder to which the Trustee (or
Insurer), the Employer or the Administrator may be a party, and such claim, suit, or proceeding is resolved in favor of the Trustee (or
Insurer), the Employer or the Administrator, they shall be entitled to be reimbursed from the Trust Fund for any and all costs, attorney's
fees, and other expenses pertaining thereto incurred by them for which they shall have become liable.
10.7 PROHIBITION AGAINST DIVERSION OF FUNDS
(a) General rule. Except as provided below and otherwise specifically permitted by law, it shall be impossible by operation of the
Plan or of the Trust, by termination of either, by power of revocation or amendment, by the happening of any contingency, by
collateral arrangement or by any other means, for any part of the corpus or income of any Trust Fund maintained pursuant to the Plan
or any funds contributed thereto to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than the exclusive benefit of Participants or their
Beneficiaries.
(b) Mistake of fact. In the event the Employer shall make a contribution under a mistake of fact pursuant to Act Â§403(c)(2)(A), the
Employer may demand repayment of such contribution at any time within one (1) year following the time of payment and the Trustee
(or Insurer) shall return such amount to the Employer within the one (1) year period. Earnings of the Plan attributable to the
contributions may not be returned to the Employer but any losses attributable thereto must reduce the amount so returned.
(c) Contribution conditioned on deductibility. Except as specifically stated in the Plan, any contribution made by the Employer to
the Plan (if the Employer is not tax-exempt) is conditioned upon the deductibility of the contribution by the Employer under the Code
and, to the extent any such deduction is disallowed, the Employer may, within one (1) year following a final determination of the
disallowance, whether by agreement with the Internal Revenue Service or by final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction,
demand repayment of such disallowed contribution and the Trustee (or Insurer) shall return such contribution within one (1) year
following the disallowance. Earnings of the Plan attributable to the contribution may not be returned to the Employer, but any losses
attributable thereto must reduce the amount so returned.

10.8 EMPLOYER'S AND TRUSTEE'S PROTECTIVE CLAUSE
The Employer, Administrator and Trustee, and their successors, shall not be responsible for the validity of any Contract issued
hereunder or for the failure on the part of the Insurer to make payments provided by any such Contract, or for the action of any person
which may delay payment or render a Contract null and void or unenforceable in whole or in part.
10.9 INSURER'S PROTECTIVE CLAUSE
Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the Employer and the Insurer, an Insurer which issues any Contracts hereunder
shall not have any responsibility for the validity of this Plan or for the tax or legal aspects of this Plan. The Insurer shall be protected and
held harmless in acting in accordance with any written direction of the Administrator or Trustee and shall have no duty to see to the
application of any funds paid to the Trustee, nor be required to question any actions directed by the Administrator or Trustee. Regardless of
any provision of this Plan, the Insurer shall not be required to take or permit any action or allow any benefit or privilege contrary to the
terms of any Contract which it issues hereunder, or the rules of the Insurer.
10.10 RECEIPT AND RELEASE FOR PAYMENTS
Any payment to any Participant, the Participant's legal representative, Beneficiary, or to any guardian or committee appointed for such
Participant or Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of this Plan, including those referenced in Section 6.9, shall, to the extent
thereof, be in full satisfaction of all claims hereunder against the Trustee (or Insurer) and the Employer.
10.11 ACTION BY THE EMPLOYER
Whenever the Employer under the terms of the Plan is permitted or required to do or perform any act or matter or thing, it shall be
done and performed by a person duly authorized by its legally constituted authority.
10.12 NAMED FIDUCIARIES AND ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITY
The "named Fiduciaries" of this Plan are (a) the Employer, (b) the Administrator, (c) the Trustee (if the Trustee has discretionary
authority), and (d) any Investment Manager appointed hereunder. The Employer may, however, modify the preceding sentence to add or
remove named Fiduciaries. The named Fiduciaries shall have only those specific powers, duties, responsibilities, and obligations as are
specifically given them under the Plan, trust agreement, or similar agreement (as applicable) including, but not limited to, any agreement
allocating or delegating their responsibilities, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. In general, the Employer shall have
the sole responsibility for making the contributions provided for under the Plan; and shall have the sole authority to appoint and remove the
Trustee and the Administrator; to formulate the Plan's "funding policy and method"; and to amend the elective provisions of the Adoption
Agreement or terminate, in whole or in part, the Plan. The Administrator shall have the sole responsibility for the administration of the
Plan, which responsibility is specifically described in the Plan. If the Trustee has discretionary authority, it shall have the sole responsibility
of management of the assets held under the Trust, except those assets, the management of which has been assigned to an Investment
Manager or Administrator, who shall be solely responsible for the management of the assets assigned to it, all as specifically provided in
the Plan. Each named Fiduciary warrants that any directions given, information furnished, or action taken by it shall be in accordance with
the provisions of the Plan, authorizing or providing for such direction, information or action. Furthermore, each named Fiduciary may rely
upon any such direction, information or action of another named Fiduciary as being proper under the Plan, and is not required under the
Plan to inquire into the propriety of any such direction, information or action. It is intended under the Plan that each named Fiduciary shall
be responsible for the proper exercise of its own powers, duties, responsibilities and obligations under the Plan. No named Fiduciary shall
guarantee the Trust Fund in any manner against investment loss or depreciation in asset value. Any person or group may serve in more than
one Fiduciary capacity.
10.13 APPROVAL BY INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if, pursuant to an application for qualification is made by the time prescribed by law
for filing the Employer's return for the taxable year in which the Plan or an amendment to the Plan is adopted, or such later date as the
Secretary of Treasury may prescribe, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service or the Commissioner's delegate should determine
that the Plan does not initially qualify as a tax-exempt plan under Code Â§Â§401 and 501, and such determination is not contested, or if
contested, is finally upheld, then if the Plan is a new plan, it shall be void ab initio and all amounts contributed to the Plan, by the
Employer, less expenses paid, shall be returned within one (1) year and the Plan shall terminate, and the Trustee (or Insurer) shall be
discharged from all further obligations. If the disqualification relates to a Plan amendment, then the Plan shall operate as if it had not been
amended. If the Employer's Plan fails to attain or retain qualification, such Plan will no longer participate in this pre-approved plan and will
be considered an individually designed plan.
10.14 PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, benefits under this Plan shall be paid, subject to Sections 6.11, 6.12 and 12.10, only upon
death, Total and Permanent Disability, normal or early retirement, severance of employment, or termination of the Plan.

10.15 ELECTRONIC MEDIA
The Administrator may use any electronic medium to give or receive any Plan notice, communicate any Plan policy, conduct any
written Plan communication, satisfy any Plan filing or other compliance requirement and conduct any other Plan transaction to the extent
permissible under applicable law. A Participant or a Participant's Spouse, to the extent authorized by the Administrator, may use any
electronic medium to make or provide any Beneficiary designation, election, notice, consent or waiver under the Plan, to the extent
permissible under applicable law. Any reference in this Plan to a "form," a "notice," an "election," a "consent," a "waiver," a "designation,"
a "policy" or to any other Plan-related communication includes an electronic version thereof as permitted under applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Participant or Beneficiary notices and consent that are required pursuant to the Code must satisfy
Regulation Â§1.401(a)-21.
10.16 PLAN CORRECTION
The Administrator in conjunction with the Employer may undertake such correction of Plan errors as the Administrator deems
necessary, including correction to preserve tax qualification of the Plan under Code Â§401(a) or to correct a fiduciary breach under the Act.
Without limiting the Administrator's authority under the prior sentence, the Administrator, as it determines to be reasonable and
appropriate, may undertake correction of Plan document, operational, demographic and Employer eligibility failures under a method
described in the Plan or under the IRS Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System ("EPCRS") or any successor program to EPCRS.
The Administrator, as it determines to be reasonable and appropriate, also may undertake or assist the appropriate Fiduciary or Plan official
in undertaking correction of a fiduciary breach, including correction under the DOL Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program ("VFC") or
any successor program to VFC. If the Plan is a 401(k) Plan, to correct an operational error, the Administrator may require the Trustee (or
Insurer) to distribute from the Plan Elective Deferrals or Vested matching contributions, including earnings, where such amounts result
from an operational error other than a failure of Code Â§415, Code Â§402(g), or a failure of the ADP or ACP tests. Furthermore, the
Employer may make corrective contributions pursuant to this Section regardless of whether the Plan otherwise permits such contribution
source. In addition, the Plan is authorized to recover benefits from Participants or Beneficiaries that have been improperly distributed.
10.17 NONTRUSTEED PLANS
If the Plan is funded solely with Contracts, then notwithstanding Sections 10.7 and 10.13, no Contract will be purchased under the
Plan unless such Contract or a separate definite written agreement between the Employer and the Insurer provides that no value under
Contracts providing benefits under the Plan or credits determined by the Insurer (on account of dividends, earnings, or other experience
rating credits, or surrender or cancellation credits) with respect to such Contracts may be paid or returned to the Employer or diverted to or
used for other than the exclusive benefit of the Participants or their Beneficiaries. However, any contribution made by the Employer
because of a mistake of fact must be returned to the Employer within one year of the contribution.
If this Plan is funded by individual Contracts that provide a Participant's benefit under the Plan, such individual Contracts shall
constitute the Participant's Account balance. If this Plan is funded by group Contracts, under the group annuity or group insurance Contract,
premiums or other consideration received by the Insurer must be allocated to Participants' Accounts under the Plan.
ARTICLE XI
PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS
11.1 ELECTION TO BECOME A PARTICIPATING EMPLOYER
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with the consent of the Employer, any Employer may adopt the Employer's Plan and
all of the provisions hereof, and participate herein and be known as a Participating Employer, by a properly executed document evidencing
said intent and will of such Participating Employer (a participation agreement). In the event a Participating Employer is not an Affiliated
Employer, then the provisions of Article XIV shall apply rather than the provision of this Article XI.
11.2 REQUIREMENTS OF PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS
(a) Permissible variations of participation agreement. The participation agreement must identify the Participating Employer and
the covered Employees and provide for the Participating Employer's signature. In addition, in the participation agreement, the
Employer shall specify which elections, if any, the Participating Employer can modify, and any restrictions on the modifications. Any
such modification shall apply only to the Employees of that Participating Employer. The Participating Employer shall make any such
modification by selecting the appropriate option on its participation agreement to the Employer's Adoption Agreement. To the extent
that the participation agreement does not permit modification of an election, any attempt by a Participating Employer to modify the
election shall have no effect on the Plan and the Participating Employer is bound by the Plan terms as selected by the Employer. If a
Participating Employer does not make any permissible participation agreement election modifications, then with regard to any
election, the Participating Employer is bound by the Adoption Agreement terms as completed by the "lead Employer."
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section, if a standardized Adoption Agreement is being used, then the elections available
to Participating Employers must be limited to the elections available to the Employer in order to ensure the Plan, by design, satisfies
the minimum coverage requirements of Code Â§410(b) and the nondiscrimination requirements of Code Â§401(a)(4).

(b) Holding and investing assets. The Trustee (or Insurer) may, but shall not be required to, commingle, hold and invest as one
Trust Fund all contributions made by Participating Employers, as well as all increments thereof. However, the assets of the Plan shall,
on an ongoing basis, be available to pay benefits to all Participants and Beneficiaries under the Plan without regard to the Employer or
Participating Employer who contributed such assets.
(c) Payment of expenses. Unless the Employer otherwise directs, any expenses of the Plan which are to be paid by the Employer or
borne by the Trust Fund shall be paid by each Participating Employer in the same proportion that the total amount standing to the
credit of all Participants employed by such Employer bears to the total standing to the credit of all Participants.
11.3 DESIGNATION OF AGENT
Each Participating Employer shall be deemed to be a part of this Plan; provided, however, that with respect to all of its relations with
the Trustee (or Insurer) and Administrator for purposes of this Plan, each Participating Employer shall be deemed to have designated
irrevocably the Employer as its agent. Unless the context of the Plan clearly indicates otherwise, the word "Employer" shall be deemed to
include each Participating Employer as related to its adoption of the Plan.
11.4 EMPLOYEE TRANSFERS
In the event an Employee is transferred between Participating Employers, accumulated service and eligibility shall be carried with the
Employee involved. No such transfer shall effect a severance of employment hereunder, and the Participating Employer to which the
Employee is transferred shall thereupon become obligated hereunder with respect to such Employee in the same manner as was the
Participating Employer from whom the Employee was transferred.
11.5 PARTICIPATING EMPLOYER'S CONTRIBUTION AND FORFEITURES
For non-standardized Adoption Agreements, if elected by a Participating Employer in its participation agreement, then to the extent
permitted under Code Â§411(d)(6), effective with respect to Plan Years beginning in and after the Plan Year in which the provisions of this
Plan are adopted, any contribution and/or Forfeiture subject to allocation during each Plan Year shall be determined and allocated
separately by each Participating Employer, and shall be allocated only among the Participants eligible to share in the contribution and
Forfeiture allocation of the Employer or Participating Employer making the contribution or by which the forfeiting Participant was
employed. Alternatively (if so elected), and with respect to standardized Adoption Agreements, any contribution or Forfeiture subject to
allocation during each Plan Year shall be allocated among all Participants of all Participating Employers in accordance with the provisions
of this Plan. However, if a Participating Employer is not an Affiliated Employer then any contributions made by such Participating
Employer will only be allocated among the Participants eligible to share in the contribution and Forfeiture allocation of the Participating
Employer.
On the basis of the information furnished by the Administrator, the Trustee (or Insurer) shall keep separate books and records
concerning the affairs of each Participating Employer hereunder and as to the accounts and credits of the Employees of each Participating
Employer. The Trustee (or Insurer) may, but need not, register Contracts so as to evidence that a particular Participating Employer is the
interested Employer hereunder, but in the event of an Employee transfer from one Participating Employer to another, the employing
Employer shall immediately notify the Trustee (or Insurer) thereof.
11.6 AMENDMENT
Any Participating Employer hereby authorizes the Employer to make amendments on its behalf, unless otherwise agreed among all
affected parties. Any such amendment is effective and binding upon existing Participating Employers.
11.7 DISCONTINUANCE OF PARTICIPATION
Except in the case of a standardized Adoption Agreement, any Participating Employer that is an Affiliated Employer shall be
permitted to discontinue or revoke its participation in the Plan at any time. At the time of any such discontinuance or revocation,
satisfactory evidence thereof and of any applicable conditions imposed shall be delivered to the Trustee (or Insurer). The Trustee (or
Insurer) shall thereafter transfer, deliver and assign Contracts and other Trust Fund assets allocable to the Participants of such Participating
Employer to such new trustee (or insurer) or custodian as shall have been designated by such Participating Employer, in the event that it
has established a separate qualified retirement plan for its employees provided, however, that no such transfer shall be made if the result is
the elimination or reduction of any "Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits" as described in Section 8.1(e). If no successor is designated, the
Trustee (or Insurer) shall retain such assets for the Employees of said Participating Employer pursuant to the provisions of Article VII
hereof. In no such event shall any part of the corpus or income of the Trust Fund as it relates to such Participating Employer be used for or
diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the Employees of such Participating Employer.

11.8 ADMINISTRATOR'S AUTHORITY
The Administrator shall have authority to make any and all necessary rules or regulations, binding upon all Participating Employers
and all Participants, to effectuate the purpose of this Article.
11.9 PARTICIPATING EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION FOR AFFILIATE
If any Participating Employer is prevented in whole or in part from making a contribution which it would otherwise have made under
the Plan by reason of having no current or accumulated earnings or profits, or because such earnings or profits are less than the contribution
which it would otherwise have made, then, pursuant to Code Â§404(a)(3)(B), so much of the contribution which such Participating Employer
was so prevented from making may be made, for the benefit of the participating employees of such Participating Employer, by other
Participating Employers who are members of the same affiliated group within the meaning of Code Â§1504 to the extent of their current or
accumulated earnings or profits, except that such contribution by each such other Participating Employer shall be limited to the proportion
of its total current and accumulated earnings or profits remaining after adjustment for its contribution to the Plan made without regard to
this paragraph which the total prevented contribution bears to the total current and accumulated earnings or profits of all the Participating
Employers remaining after adjustment for all contributions made to the Plan without regard to this paragraph.
A Participating Employer on behalf of whose employees a contribution is made under this paragraph shall not be required to
reimburse the contributing Participating Employers.
ARTICLE XII
CASH OR DEFERRED PROVISIONS
Except as specifically provided elsewhere in this Plan, the provisions of this Article shall apply with respect to any 401(k) Profit
Sharing Plan regardless of any provisions in the Plan to the contrary.
12.1 FORMULA FOR DETERMINING EMPLOYER'S CONTRIBUTION
(a) Permitted contributions. For each Plan Year, the Employer will (or may with respect to any discretionary contributions)
contribute to the Plan:
(1) The amount of the total salary deferral elections of all Participants made pursuant to Section 12.2(a), which amount shall be
deemed Elective Deferrals, plus
(2) If elected in the Adoption Agreement, a matching contribution equal to the percentage, if any, specified in the Adoption
Agreement of the Elective Deferrals of each Participant eligible to share in the allocations of the matching contribution, which
amount shall be deemed an Employer matching contribution or Qualified Matching Contribution as elected in the Adoption
Agreement, plus
(3) If elected in the Adoption Agreement, a discretionary amount determined each year by the Employer, which amount if any,
shall be deemed an Employer Nonelective Contribution, or a "prevailing wage contribution" as set forth in the Adoption
Agreement, which amount shall be an Employer Nonelective Contribution or a Qualified Nonelective Contribution as elected in
the Adoption Agreement, plus
(4) A Qualified Nonelective Contribution in a discretionary amount, subject to the provisions of Section 12.12.
(5) Regardless of any provision in the Plan to the contrary, Employees whose employment is governed by a collective
bargaining agreement between the Employer and "employee representatives" under which retirement benefits were the subject of
good faith bargaining shall be eligible to participate in this Plan to the extent of employment covered by such agreement provided
the agreement provides for coverage in the Plan. The contributions and allocations under this Plan shall be those set forth in the
collective bargaining agreement and enumerated in the Adoption Agreement. For this purpose, the term "employee
representatives" does not include any organization more than half of whose members are employees who are owners, officers, or
executives of the Employer. The provisions of this Subsection only apply if no more than two percent (2%) of the Employees
covered pursuant to the agreement are professionals as defined in Regulation Â§1.410(b)-9.
(b) Timing and form of contributions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Employer is not a tax-exempt entity, then the
Employer's contributions for any Fiscal Year may generally not exceed the maximum amount allowable as a deduction to the
Employer under the provisions of Code Â§404. However, to the extent necessary to provide the top-heavy minimum allocations, the
Employer shall make a contribution even if it exceeds current or accumulated net profit or the amount that is deductible under Code
Â§404. Subject to the consent of the Trustee (or Insurer), the Employer may make its contribution to the Plan in the form of property,
provided such contribution does not constitute a prohibited transaction under the Code or the Act. The decision to make a contribution
of property is subject to the general fiduciary rules under the Act.

12.2 PARTICIPANT'S SALARY DEFERRAL ELECTION
(a) Salary deferral elections. Each Participant may elect to defer a portion of Compensation which would have been received in the
Plan Year, but for the salary deferral election, subject to the limitations of this Section and the Adoption Agreement. A salary deferral
election (or modification of an earlier election) may not be made with respect to Compensation which is currently available on or
before the date the Participant executed such election, or if later, the later of the date the Employer adopts this cash or deferred
arrangement or the date such arrangement first became effective. Any elections made pursuant to this Section, including a
modification or termination of an election, shall become effective as soon as is administratively feasible following the receipt of such
election by the Administrator. Furthermore, if the Employer elects in the Adoption Agreement to apply the Automatic Contribution
Arrangement provisions, then in the event a Participant fails to make an Affirmative Election, such Participant shall be deemed to
have made a salary deferral election in accordance with the provisions selected in the Adoption Agreement and such other procedures
that the Administrator may establish and apply in a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis.
Regardless of the definition of Compensation selected in the Adoption Agreement, the Administrator may adopt a uniform policy
for purposes of determining the amount of a Participant's Elective Deferrals by excluding "non-cash Compensation." For purposes of
this Section, "non-cash Compensation" means tips, fringe benefits, and other items of Compensation not regularly paid in cash or cash
equivalents, or for which the Employer does not or may not have the ability to withhold Elective Deferrals in cash for the purpose of
transmitting the Elective Deferrals to the Plan pursuant to the Participant's Salary Deferral Agreement. Additionally, the Employer
may, on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis, permit different salary deferral elections for different items of Compensation (e.g., a
separate salary deferral election for bonuses), and may exclude for purposes of calculating Elective Deferrals one or more items of
irregular pay (e.g., bonuses or car allowances).
If elected in the Adoption Agreement, effective as of the date specified in the Adoption Agreement, a Participant may make a
salary deferral election to have Roth Elective Deferrals contributed to the Plan. Roth Elective Deferrals are includible in the
Participant's gross income at the time deferred and must be irrevocably designated as Roth Elective Deferrals by the Participant in the
Salary Deferral Agreement (or if applicable, in the Automatic Deferral provisions of the Plan).
The amount by which Compensation is reduced shall be that Participant's Elective Deferrals and shall be treated as an Employer
contribution and allocated to that Participant's Elective Deferral Account. If the Plan permits Roth Elective Deferral contributions,
then a Participant's Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals shall be allocated to the Participant's Pre-Tax Elective Deferral Account and a
Participant's Roth Elective Deferrals shall be allocated to the Participant's Roth Elective Deferral Account. Except in the case of an
"in-Plan Roth Rollover Contribution" made pursuant to Section 12.11, Elective Deferrals contributed to the Plan as one type, either
Roth Elective Deferrals or Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals, may not later be reclassified as the other type.
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, Participants may not make Elective Deferrals with respect to amounts that
are not 415 Compensation. However, for this purpose, 415 Compensation is not limited to the annual compensation limit of Code
Â§401(a)(17). Furthermore, for purposes of this Section, the annual dollar limitation of Code Â§401(a)(17) ($200,000 as adjusted) shall
not apply except that the Administrator may elect to apply such limit as part of the salary deferral election procedures established
hereunder. In applying any Plan limit(s) on Elective Deferrals which are subject to matching contributions, where such limits are
expressed as a percentage of Compensation, the Administrator may apply the Compensation limit under this Section annually, even if
the matching contribution formula is applied on any time interval which is less than the full Plan Year or the Administrator may pro
rate the Compensation limit.
Once made, a Participant's election to reduce Compensation shall remain in effect until modified or terminated. The
Administrator shall establish procedures setting forth the conditions on modifications of an election. However, Participants must be
permitted to modify elections at least once each Plan Year. Furthermore, terminations may be made at any time.
(b) Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangement (EACA). If elected in the Adoption Agreement, the Employer maintains a Plan
with Automatic Deferral provisions as an Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangement (EACA) and the following provisions will
apply:
(1) Participants subject to EACA. The Employer in its Adoption Agreement will elect which Participants are subject to the
EACA Automatic Deferral on the "EACA Effective Date" thereof which may include some or all current Participants or may be
limited to those Employees who become Participants after the EACA Effective Date. The "EACA Effective Date" means the date
on which the EACA goes into effect, either as to the overall Plan or as to an individual Participants as the context requires. An
EACA becomes effective as to the Plan as of the date the Employer elects in the Adoption Agreement. A Participant's "EACA
Effective Date" is as soon as practicable after the Participant is subject to Automatic Deferrals under the EACA, consistent with:
(i) applicable law; and (ii) the objective of affording the Participant a reasonable period of time after receipt of the EACA notice
to make an Affirmative Election (and, if applicable, an investment election).

[PAGE 74]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(2) Uniformity. The Automatic Deferral percentage must be a uniform percentage of Compensation. However, the Plan does
not violate the uniform Automatic Deferral percentage requirement merely because the Plan applies any of the following
provisions:
(i) Years of participation. The Automatic Deferral percentage varies based on the number of Plan Years (or portions) the
Participant has participated in the Plan while the Plan has applied EACA provisions;
(ii) No reduction from prior percentage. The Plan does not reduce a deferral percentage that, immediately prior to the
EACA's effective date was higher (for any Participant) than the Automatic Deferral percentage;
(iii) Applying statutory limits. The Plan limits the Automatic Deferral amount so as not to exceed the limits of Code
Â§401(a)(17), 402(g) (determined without regard to Age 50 Catch-Up Deferrals), or 415;
(iv) No Automatic Deferrals during hardship suspension. The Plan does not apply the Automatic Deferral during a
period of suspension, under the Plan's hardship distribution provisions, of Participant's right to make Elective Deferrals to
the Plan following a hardship distribution; or
(v) Disaggregated groups. The Plan applies different default percentages to different groups if the groups can be
disaggregated under Regulation Â§1.401(k)-1(b)(4).
(3) EACA notice. The Administrator annually will provide a notice to each Participant covered by the EACA provisions
(including, if elected in the Adoption Agreement, Participants who made an Affirmative Election) within a reasonable period of
time prior to each Plan Year the Employer maintains the Plan as an EACA ("EACA Plan Year").
(i) Deemed reasonable notice/new Participant. The Administrator is deemed to provide timely notice if the
Administrator provides the EACA notice at least thirty (30) days and not more than ninety (90) days prior to the beginning
of the EACA Plan Year.
(ii) Mid-year notice/new Participant or Plan. If: (A) an Employee becomes eligible to make Elective Deferrals in the
Plan during an EACA Plan Year but after the Administrator has provided the annual EACA notice for that Plan Year; or (B)
the Employer adopts mid-year a new Plan as an EACA, the Administrator must provide the EACA notice no later than the
date the Employee becomes eligible to make Elective Deferrals. However, if it is not practicable for the notice to be
provided on or before the date an Employee becomes a Participant, then the notice will nonetheless be treated as provided
timely if it is provided as soon as practicable after that date and the Employee is permitted to elect to defer from all types of
Compensation that may be deferred under the Plan earned beginning on that date.
(iii) Content. The EACA notice must provide comprehensive information regarding the Participants' rights and obligations
under the Plan and must be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average Participant in accordance with
applicable law.
(4) EACA permissible withdrawal. If elected in the Adoption Agreement, a Participant who has Automatic Deferrals under
the EACA may elect to withdraw all the Automatic Deferrals (and allocable earnings) under the provisions of this Subsection.
Any distribution made pursuant to this Section will be processed in accordance with normal distribution provisions of the Plan.
(i) Amount. If a Participant elects a permissible withdrawal under this Subsection, then the Plan must make a distribution
equal to the amount (and only the amount) of the Automatic Deferrals made under the EACA (adjusted for allocable gains
and losses to the date of the distribution). The Plan may separately account for Automatic Deferrals, in which case the entire
account will be distributed. If the Plan does not separately account for the Automatic Deferrals, then the Plan must
determine earnings or losses in a manner similar to the refund of Excess Contributions.
(ii) Fees. Notwithstanding the above, the Administrator may reduce the permissible distribution amount by any generally
applicable fees. However, the Plan may not charge a greater fee for distribution under this Section than applies to other
distributions. The Administrator may adopt a policy regarding charging such fees consistent with this paragraph.
(iii) Timing. The Participant may make an election to withdraw the Automatic Deferrals under the EACA no later than
ninety (90) days, or such shorter period as specified in the Adoption Agreement, after the date of the first Automatic
Deferral under the EACA. For this purpose, the date of the first Automatic Deferral is the date that the Compensation
subject to the Automatic Deferral otherwise would have been includible in the Participant's gross income. For this purpose,
EACAs under the Plan are aggregated, except that the mandatory disaggregation rules of Code Â§410(b) apply. In addition, a
Participant's withdrawal right is not restricted due to the Participant making an Affirmative Election during the ninety (90)
day period (or shorter period as specified in the Adoption Agreement).

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(iv) Rehired Employees. For purposes of paragraph (iii) above, an Employee who for an entire Plan Year did not have
contributions made pursuant to a default election under the EACA will be treated as having not had such contributions for
any prior Plan Year as well.
(v) Effective date of the withdrawal election. The effective date of the permissible withdrawal will be as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than the earlier of (A) the pay date of the second payroll period beginning after the election
is made, or (B) the first pay date that occurs at least thirty (30) days after the election is made. The election will also be
deemed to be an Affirmative Election to have no Elective Deferrals made to the Plan.
(vi) Related matching contributions. The Administrator will not take any Elective Deferrals withdrawn pursuant to this
Section into account in computing and allocating matching contributions. If the Employer has already allocated matching
contributions to the Participant's Account with respect to Elective Deferrals being withdrawn pursuant to this Subsection (4),
then such matching contributions, as adjusted for gains and losses, must be forfeited.
(vii) Treatment of withdrawals. With regard to Elective Deferrals withdrawn pursuant to this Subsection, (A) the
Administrator will disregard such Elective Deferrals in the Actual Deferral Percentage Test (if applicable); (B) the
Administrator will disregard such Elective Deferrals for purposes of the limitation on Elective Deferrals under Code
Â§402(g); (C) such Elective Deferrals are not subject to the consent requirements of Code Â§401(a)(11) or 417. The
Administrator will disregard any matching contributions forfeited under paragraph (vi) above in the ACP Test (if
applicable).
(viii)Effect of Affirmative Election. A Participant's Affirmative Election continues in effect until the Participant
subsequently revokes or modifies his or her Salary Deferral Agreement, or the Affirmative Election no longer applies (e.g.,
due to re-enrollment). A Participant who has an Affirmative Election in effect is not thereafter subject to the Automatic
Deferral or to any scheduled increases thereto, even if the Participant later revokes the Affirmative Election, unless the
Participant is subject to the EACA. In addition, a Participant who is subject to the EACA provisions who revokes his or her
Affirmative Election, will be deemed to have made an Affirmative Election to have no Elective Deferrals made to the Plan.
(c) Catch-Up Contributions. If selected in the Adoption Agreement, all Employees who are eligible to make Elective Deferrals
under this Plan and who have attained age 50 before the close of the taxable year shall be eligible to make Catch-Up Contributions in
accordance with, and subject to the dollar limitations of, Code Â§414(v)(2)(B)(i) for the taxable year. The limit will be adjusted by the
Secretary of the Treasury for cost-of-living increases under Code Â§414(v)(2)(C). Such Catch-Up Contributions shall not be taken into
account for purposes of the provisions of the Plan implementing the required limitations of Code Â§Â§402(g) and 415. The Plan shall not
be treated as failing to satisfy the provisions of the Plan implementing the requirements of Code Â§401(k)(3), 401(k)(11), 401(k)(12),
410(b), or 416, as applicable, by reason of the making of such Catch-Up Contributions (but Catch-Up Contributions made in prior
years are counted in determining whether the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan). If selected in the Adoption Agreement, Catch-Up
Contributions shall not be treated as Elective Deferrals for purposes of applying any Employer matching contributions. Such option
cannot be selected if the Plan elects to follow the safe harbor provisions of Section 12.8.
(d) Full vesting. The balance in each Participant's Elective Deferral Account, Qualified Matching Contribution Account and
Qualified Nonelective Contribution Account shall be fully Vested at all times and, except as otherwise provided herein, shall not be
subject to Forfeiture for any reason.
(e) Distribution restrictions. Amounts held in a Participant's Elective Deferral Account, Qualified Matching Contribution Account
and Qualified Nonelective Contribution Account may only be distributable as provided in (4) below or as provided under the other
provisions of this Plan, but in no event prior to the earlier of the following events or any other events permitted by the Code or
Regulations:
(1) the Participant's severance of employment (regardless of when the severance of employment occurred), Total and Permanent
Disability, or death;
(2) the Participant's attainment of age 59 1/2;
(3) the proven financial hardship of the Participant, subject to the limitations of Section 12.10(d) (or, for a non-standardized
Adoption Agreement, Section 6.12);
(4) the termination of the Plan without the existence at the time of Plan termination of another defined contribution plan or the
establishment of a successor defined contribution plan by the Employer or an Affiliated Employer within the period ending
twelve months after distribution of all assets from the Plan maintained by the Employer. For this purpose, a defined contribution
plan does not include an employee stock ownership plan (as defined in Code Â§4975(e)(7) or 409(a)), a simplified employee
pension plan (as defined in Code Â§408(k)), a SIMPLE individual retirement account plan (as defined in Code Â§408(p)), a plan or
contract that satisfies the requirements of Code Â§403(b), or a plan that is described in Code Â§457(b) or (f). A distribution that is
made because of this paragraph (4) must be made in a lump-sum;

[PAGE 76]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(5) the Participant's call to active duty, because of the Participant's status as a member of a reserve component, for a period of at
least 180 days or for an indefinite period, i.e., a "qualified reservist distribution" within the meaning of Section 6.18; or
(6) a Participant's service in the uniformed services while on active duty for a period of at least 30 days, i.e., a "deemed
distribution" within the meaning of Section 6.18.
(f) Code Â§402(g) dollar limit. A Participant's Elective Deferrals made under this Plan and all other plans, contracts or arrangements
of the Employer maintaining this Plan during any calendar year shall not exceed the dollar limitation imposed by Code Â§402(g), as in
effect at the beginning of such calendar year, except to the extent permitted under Section 12.2(c) and Code Â§414(v), if applicable.
The limit will be adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for cost-of-living increases under Code Â§402(g)(4). For this purpose,
"elective deferrals" means, with respect to a calendar year, the sum of all Employer contributions made on behalf of such Participant
pursuant to an election to defer under any qualified cash or deferred arrangement as described in Code Â§401(k), any salary reduction
simplified employee pension (as defined in Code Â§408(k)(6)), any SIMPLE IRA plan described in Code Â§408(p), any eligible deferred
compensation plan under Code Â§457, any plans described under Code Â§501(c)(18), and any Employer contributions made on the
behalf of a Participant for the purchase of an annuity contract under Code Â§403(b) pursuant to a salary deferral agreement.
(g) Excess Deferrals. If a Participant has Excess Deferrals for a taxable year, the Participant may, not later than March 1st following
the close of such taxable year, notify the Administrator in writing of such excess and request that the Participant's Elective Deferrals
under this Plan be reduced by an amount specified by the Participant. In such event, the Administrator shall direct the distribution of
such excess amount (and any "income" allocable to such excess amount) to the Participant not later than the first April 15th following
the close of the Participant's taxable year. Any distribution of less than the entire amount of Excess Deferrals and "income" shall be
treated as a pro rata distribution of Excess Deferrals and "income." The amount distributed shall not exceed the Participant's Elective
Deferrals under the Plan for the taxable year. Any distribution on or before the last day of the Participant's taxable year must satisfy
each of the following conditions:
(1) the Participant shall designate the distribution as Excess Deferrals;
(2) the distribution must be made after the date on which the Plan received the Excess Deferrals; and
(3) the Plan must designate the distribution as a distribution of Excess Deferrals.
Regardless of the preceding, if a Participant has Excess Deferrals solely from Elective Deferrals made under this Plan or any
other plan maintained by the Employer, a Participant will be deemed to have notified the Administrator of such excess amount and the
Administrator shall direct the distribution of such Excess Deferrals in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Subsection.
For the purpose of this Subsection, "income" means the amount of income or loss allocable to a Participant's Excess Deferrals,
which amount shall be allocated in the same manner as income or losses are allocated pursuant to Section 4.3(c). The Administrator
may not distribute "income" allocable to Excess Deferrals for the period between the end of the Participant's taxable year in which the
Excess Deferral occurred and the date of the distribution (the "gap period").
Notwithstanding the above, for any years in which a Participant makes both Roth Elective Deferrals and Pre-Tax Elective
Deferrals, the distribution of any Excess Deferrals for such year shall be made, as operationally determined by the Administrator, from
the Participant's Pre-Tax Elective Deferral Account or Participant's Roth Elective Deferral Account. Matching contributions which
relate to Excess Elective Deferrals (regardless of whether such Excess Elective Deferrals are Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals or Roth
Elective Deferrals) shall be treated as a Forfeiture.
Any distribution of Excess Deferrals made pursuant to this Subsection shall be made first from unmatched Elective Deferrals
(regardless of whether they are attributable to Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals or Roth Elective Deferrals) and, thereafter, from Elective
Deferrals which are matched. Matching contributions which relate to Excess Deferrals that are distributed pursuant to this Section
12.2(g) shall be treated as a Forfeiture to the extent required pursuant to Code Â§401(a)(4) and the Regulations thereunder.
(h) Coordination with ADP test. Notwithstanding the preceding, a Participant's Excess Deferrals shall be reduced, but not below
zero, by any distribution and/or recharacterization of Excess Deferrals pursuant to Section 12.5(b) for the Plan Year beginning with or
within the taxable year of the Participant.
(i) Suspension due to hardship or deemed severance. In the event a Participant has received a hardship distribution pursuant to
Regulation Â§1.401(k)-1(d)(3) from any other plan maintained by the Employer or from the Participant's Elective Deferral Account
pursuant to Section 12.10, or has received a distribution on account of deemed severance on account of qualified military service from
this Plan or any other plan maintained by the Employer, then such Participant shall not be permitted to elect to have Elective Deferrals
contributed to the Plan in accordance with the rules set forth herein for such distributions.
(j) Distributable based on other terms of Plan. At Normal Retirement Date, or such other date when the Participant shall be
entitled to receive benefits, the fair market value of the Participant's Elective Deferral Account shall be used to provide benefits to the
Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary.

[PAGE 77]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(k) Adjustment due to anticipated failure of ADP test. If during a Plan Year, it is projected that the aggregate amount of Elective
Deferrals to be allocated to all Highly Compensated Participants under this Plan would cause the Plan to fail the tests set forth in
Section 12.4, then the Administrator may automatically reduce the Elective Deferrals of affected Highly Compensated Participants,
beginning with the Highly Compensated Participant who has the highest actual deferral ratio until it is anticipated the Plan will pass
the tests or until the actual deferral ratio equals the actual deferral ratio of the Highly Compensated Participant having the next highest
actual deferral ratio. This process may continue until it is anticipated that the Plan will satisfy one of the tests set forth in Section 12.4.
Alternatively, the Employer may specify a maximum percentage of Compensation that may be deferred by Highly Compensated
Participants (and any such limitation shall be a Plan-imposed limit for purposes of determining Catch-up Contributions).
(l) Procedures must be established. The Employer and the Administrator shall establish procedures necessary to implement the
salary deferral elections provided for herein. Such procedures may contain limits on salary deferral elections such as limiting elections
to whole percentages of Compensation or to equal dollar amounts per pay period that an election is in effect. The Employer may elect
to impose a limit on Elective Deferrals in the Adoption Agreement, as amended from time to time and accompanied by providing
timely notice to the Participants. Any such limit change made during a Plan Year applies only prospectively and applies until the
Administrator changes or revokes the limit. The Employer and Administrator may not, however, in a SIMPLE 401(k) Plan impose any
Plan limit on Elective Deferrals except as provided under Code Â§408(p).
(1) Automatic contribution arrangements. Unless otherwise provided in Subsection (b) above or any elections in the
Adoption Agreement, the procedures may provide for a reasonable period time for a Participant to election out of the automatic
contribution arrangement or the Automatic Deferral and/or Automatic Escalation of Affirmative Election provisions. The
Employer may also provide for the re-enrollment of all or some Participants (such as requiring re-enrollment for just those
Participants who have an Affirmative Election below a certain percentage or amount). Furthermore, the Plan has a reasonable
period of time to implement an Automatic Deferral or an Automatic Escalation after a Participant is first subject to the Automatic
Deferral and/or Automatic Escalation of Affirmative Election provisions. Such Automatic Escalation cannot be more frequently
than annually. If this Section applies to a Participant, then each year on the Change Date specified in the Adoption Agreement,
the Participantâs affirmative deferral election will expire. If the Participant fails to complete a new affirmative election
subsequent to the Change Date, the Participant becomes subject to the adjusted deferral percentage determined under Election 27
of the Adoption Agreement. Each year, the Participant can always complete a new affirmative election and designate a new
deferral percentage.
(2) Rehired Participants. Unless otherwise provided in Subsection (b) above, any elections in the Adoption Agreement,
the Salary Deferral Agreement, or the Planâs procedures, the termination of a Participant's employment with the Employer
automatically revokes the Participant's Salary Deferral Agreement with regard to periods after the Participant is rehired. The Plan
is permitted to establish procedures whereby termination of employment for a short period of time will not revoke an Affirmative
Election or be treated as a termination of employment for purposes of the Planâs Automatic Contribution Arrangement and/or
Automatic Escalation of Affirmative Election provisions.
12.3 ALLOCATION OF CONTRIBUTIONS AND FORFEITURES
(a) Separate accounting. The Administrator shall establish and maintain an account in the name of each Participant to which the
Administrator shall credit as of each Anniversary Date, or other Valuation Date, all amounts allocated to each such Participant as set
forth herein.
(b) Contributions. The Employer shall provide the Administrator with all information required by the Administrator to make a
proper allocation of Employer contributions for each Plan Year. Within a reasonable period of time after the date of receipt by the
Administrator of such information, the Administrator shall allocate contributions as follows:
(1) With respect to Elective Deferrals made pursuant to Section 12.1(a)(1), to each Participant's Elective Deferral Account in an
amount equal to each such Participant's Elective Deferrals for the year.
(2) With respect to the Employer matching contribution made pursuant to Section 12.1(a)(2), to each Participant's Account, or
Participant's Qualified Matching Contribution Account, as elected in the Adoption Agreement, in accordance with
Section 12.1(a)(2) and Section 12.12.
Except, however, in order to be entitled to receive any Employer matching contribution, a Participant must satisfy the
conditions for sharing in the Employer matching contribution as set forth in the Adoption Agreement.
(3) With respect to the Employer Nonelective Contribution made pursuant to Section 12.1(a)(3), to each Participant's Account
in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.3(b)(2) or (3) (including the "gateway contribution" pursuant to Section 4.3(b)(4)),
whichever is applicable.
(4) With respect to the Employer Qualified Nonelective Contribution made pursuant to Section 12.1(a)(4), to each Participant's
Qualified Nonelective Contribution Account in the amount specified by the Employer. With respect to a standardized Adoption

[PAGE 78]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
Agreement, however, if an HCE will receive an allocation of the Qualified Nonelective Contribution made pursuant to Section
12.1(a)(4), then the contribution shall be allocated to each Participant's Qualified Nonelective Contribution Account in the same
ratio as each Participant's Compensation bears to the total of such Compensation of all Participants.
(c) Elective Deferrals not taken into account Top-Heavy minimums. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, in
determining whether a Non-Key Employee (and Key Employee if elected in the Adoption Agreement) has received the required
minimum allocation pursuant to Section 4.3(f) such Non-Key Employee's (and Key Employeeâs) Elective Deferrals shall not be taken
into account. In addition, unless otherwise specified in Appendix A to the Adoption Agreement (Special Effective Dates and Other
Permitted Elections), Employer matching contributions shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the minimum
contribution requirements of Code Â§416(c)(2) and the Plan. The preceding sentence shall apply with respect to matching contributions
under the Plan or, if the Plan provides that the minimum contribution requirement shall be met in another plan, such other plan.
Employer matching contributions that are used to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements shall be treated as matching
contributions for purposes of the ACP test and other requirements of Code Â§401(m).
(d) Elective Deferrals not conditioned on service during a year. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Participants who
terminated employment during the Plan Year shall share in the Elective Deferral contributions made by the Employer for the year of
termination without regard to the Hours of Service credited.
(e) Conditions for sharing in contributions/allocations. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (other than Sections
3.5(h), 4.3(f) and 12.3(f)), Participants shall only share in the allocations of the Employer matching contribution made pursuant to
Section 12.1(a)(2), the Employer Nonelective Contributions made pursuant to Section 12.1(a)(3), the Employer Qualified Nonelective
Contribution made pursuant to Section 12.1(a)(4), and Forfeitures as provided in the Adoption Agreement. If no election is made in
the Adoption Agreement, then a Participant shall be eligible to share in the allocation of the Employer's contribution for the year if the
Participant completes more than 500 Hours of Service (or three (3) consecutive calendar months if the elapsed time method is chosen
in the Adoption Agreement) during the Plan Year or is employed on the last day of the Plan Year.
(f) Code Â§410(b) fail-safe. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, if, in the non-standardized Adoption
Agreement, the Employer elected to apply the 410(b) ratio percentage fail-safe provisions, then the provisions of Section 4.3(m) shall
apply. Furthermore, if the Plan includes Employer matching contributions subject to ACP testing, then Section 4.3(m) shall be applied
separately to the Code Â§401(m) portion of the Plan.
12.4 ACTUAL DEFERRAL PERCENTAGE TESTS
(a) ADP test. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Subsection applies if the prior year testing method is elected in the Adoption
Agreement. The "Actual Deferral Percentage" (hereinafter ADP) for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly Compensated
Employees (hereinafter "HCEs") for each Plan Year and the prior year's ADP for Participants who were Nonhighly Compensated
Employees (hereinafter "NHCEs") for the prior Plan Year must satisfy one of the following tests:
(1) The ADP for a Plan Year for Participants who are "HCEs" for the Plan Year shall not exceed the prior year's ADP for
Participants who were "NHCEs" for the prior Plan Year multiplied by 1.25; or
(2) The ADP for a Plan Year for Participants who are "HCEs" for the Plan Year shall not exceed the prior year's ADP for
Participants who were "NHCEs" for the prior Plan Year multiplied by 2.0, provided that the ADP for Participants who are
"HCEs" does not exceed the prior year's ADP for Participants who were "NHCEs" in the prior Plan Year by more than two (2)
percentage points.
Notwithstanding the above, for purposes of applying the foregoing tests with respect to the first Plan Year (as defined in
Regulation Â§1.401(k)-2(c)(2)) in which the Plan permits any Participant to make Elective Deferrals, the ADP for the prior year's
"NHCEs" shall be the greater of three percent (3%) or the current Plan Year's ADP for these Participants. However, the provisions of
this paragraph may not be used if the Plan is a successor plan or is otherwise prohibited from using such provisions pursuant to
Regulation Â§1.401(k)-2(c)(2).
(b) Current year testing method. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the current year testing method is elected in the Adoption
Agreement, or if no election is made in the Adoption Agreement, and for any Plan Year for which the Employer has either reserved
the right to make a nonelective "ADP test safe harbor contribution" pursuant to Section 12.8 or amended the Plan to make an "ADP
test safe harbor contribution," the ADP tests in (a)(1) and (a)(2) above shall be applied by comparing the current Plan Year's ADP for
Participants who are "HCEs" with the current Plan Year's ADP (rather than the prior Plan Year's ADP) for Participants who are
"NHCEs" for the current Plan Year. Once made, the Employer can elect prior year testing for a Plan Year only if the Plan has used
current year testing for each of the preceding 5 Plan Years (or if lesser, the number of Plan Years the Plan has been in existence) or if,
as a result of a merger or acquisition described in Code Â§410(b)(6)(C)(i), the Employer maintains both a plan using prior year testing
and a plan using current year testing and the change is made within the transition period described in Code Â§410(b)(6)(C)(ii).

(c) Determination of "HCEs" and "NHCEs." A Participant is an "HCE" for a particular Plan Year if the Participant meets the
definition of an "HCE" in effect for that Plan Year. Similarly, a Participant is an "NHCE" for a particular Plan Year if the Participant
does not meet the definition of an "HCE" in effect for that Plan Year.
(d) Calculation of ADP. For the purposes of this Section and Section 12.5, ADP means, for a specific group of Participants for a
Plan Year, the average of the ratios (calculated separately for each Participant in such group) of (1) the amount of Employer
contributions actually paid over to the Plan on behalf of such Participant for the Plan Year to (2) the Participant's 414(s) Compensation
for such Plan Year. Employer contributions on behalf of any Participant shall only include: (1) any Elective Deferrals made pursuant
to the Participant's salary deferral election (including Excess Deferrals of "HCEs"), but excluding (i) Excess Deferrals of "NHCEs"
that arise solely from Elective Deferrals made under the plan or plans of this Employer and (ii) Elective Deferrals that are taken into
account in the ACP tests set forth in Section 12.6 (provided the ADP test is satisfied both with and without exclusion of these Elective
Deferrals); and (2) except as provided in Subsections (f) and (g), at the election of the Employer, all or a portion of any Qualified
Nonelective Contributions and Qualified Matching Contributions that are not used to satisfy the ACP test.
The actual deferral ratio for each Participant and the ADP for each group shall be calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of one
percent. Furthermore, Elective Deferrals allocated to each Highly Compensated Participant's Elective Deferral Account shall not be
reduced by Excess Deferrals to the extent such excess amounts are made under this Plan or any other plan maintained by the
Employer.
(e) Participants taken into account. For purposes of this Section and Section 12.5, a Highly Compensated Participant and a
Nonhighly Compensated Participant shall include any Employee eligible to make salary deferrals pursuant to Section 12.2 for the Plan
Year. Such Participants who fail to make Elective Deferrals shall be treated for ADP purposes as Participants on whose behalf no
Elective Deferrals are made. If a Participant has no 414(s) Compensation for the Plan Year, then such Participant is disregarded for
purposes of calculating the ADP test.
(f) Contributions taken into account. For purposes of determining the ADP and the amount of Excess Contributions pursuant to
Section 12.5, only Qualified Nonelective Contributions and Qualified Matching Contributions contributed to the Plan prior to the end
of the twelve (12) month period immediately following the Plan Year to which the contributions relate shall be considered. A
Participant's Elective Deferrals are only taken into account for purposes of determining the ADP for a Plan Year if allocated to the
Participant's Elective Deferral Account as of a date within that Plan Year and are only made with respect to Compensation that would
have either been received by the Participant in the Plan Year (but for the salary deferral election) or is attributable to services
performed by the Participant in the Plan Year and would have been paid within two and one-half (2 1/2) months after the close of the
Plan Year (but for the salary deferral election).
(g) Targeted contributions. Notwithstanding the preceding, Qualified Nonelective Contributions cannot be taken into account in
determining the ADP for a Plan Year for an "NHCE" to the extent such contributions exceed the product of that "NHCE's" 414(s)
Compensation and the greater of five percent (5%) or two (2) times the Plan's "representative contribution rate." Any Qualified
Nonelective Contribution taken into account under an ACP test under Regulation Â§1.401(m)-2(a)(6) (including the determination of
the "representative contribution rate" for purposes of Regulation Â§1.401(m)-2(a)(6)(v)(B)), is not permitted to be taken into account
for purposes of this paragraph (including the determination of the "representative contribution rate" under this Section). For purposes
of this Subsection:
(1) The Plan's "representative contribution rate" is the lowest "applicable contribution rate" of any eligible "NHCE" among a
group of eligible "NHCEs" that consists of half of all eligible "NHCEs" for the Plan Year (or, if greater, the lowest "applicable
contribution rate" of any eligible "NHCE" in the group of all eligible "NHCEs" for the Plan Year and who is employed by the
Employer on the last day of the Plan Year), and
(2) The "applicable contribution rate" for an eligible "NHCE" is the sum of the Qualified Matching Contributions taken into
account under Subsection (d) for the eligible "NHCE" for the Plan Year and the Qualified Nonelective Contributions made for
the eligible "NHCE" for the Plan Year, divided by the eligible "NHCE's" 414(s) Compensation for the same period.
Notwithstanding the above, Qualified Nonelective Contributions that are made in connection with an Employer's obligation to
pay prevailing wages under the Davis-Bacon Act (46 Stat. 1494), Public Law 71-798, Service Contract Act of 1965 (79 Stat. 1965),
Public Law 89-286, or similar legislation can be taken into account for a Plan Year for an "NHCE" to the extent such contributions do
not exceed 10 percent (10%) of that "NHCE's" 414(s) Compensation.
Qualified Matching Contributions may only be used to calculate the ADP to the extent that such Qualified Matching
Contributions are matching contributions that are not precluded from being taken into account under the ACP test for the Plan Year
under the rules of Regulation Â§1.401(m)-2(a)(5)(ii).
Qualified Nonelective Contributions and Qualified Matching Contributions cannot be taken into account to determine the ADP to
the extent such contributions are taken into account for purposes of satisfying any other ADP test, any ACP test, or the requirements
of Regulation Â§1.401(k)-3, 1.401(m)-3 or 1.401(k)-4. Thus, for example, matching contributions that are made pursuant to Regulation
Â§1.401(k)-3(c) cannot be taken into account under the ADP test. Similarly, if a plan switches from the current year testing method to
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers
74

[PAGE 80]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
the prior year testing method pursuant to Regulation Â§1.401(k)-2(c), Qualified Nonelective Contributions that are taken into account
under the current year testing method for a year may not be taken into account under the prior year testing method for the next year as
Qualified Nonelective Contributions used to correct or lessen the degree of an ADP testing failure may only be made utilizing the
current year testing method..
(h) Aggregation with other plans. In the event this Plan satisfies the requirements of Code Â§401(a)(4), 401(k), or 410(b) only if
aggregated with one or more other plans, or if one or more other plans satisfy the requirements of such sections of the Code only if
aggregated with this Plan, then this Section shall be applied by determining the ADP of Employees as if all such plans were a single
plan. If more than ten percent (10%) of the Employer's "NHCEs" are involved in a plan coverage change as defined in Regulation
Â§1.401(k)-2(c)(4), then any adjustments to the "NHCEs" ADP for the prior year will be made in accordance with such Regulations, if
the Employer has elected in the Adoption Agreement to use the prior year testing method. Plans may be aggregated in order to satisfy
Code Â§401(k) only if they have the same Plan Year and use the same ADP testing method.
(i) ADP if multiple plans. The ADP for any Participant who is an "HCE" for the Plan Year and who is eligible to have Elective
Deferrals (and Qualified Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions, or both, if treated as Elective Deferrals for
purposes of the ADP test) allocated to such Participant's accounts under two (2) or more arrangements described in Code Â§401(k), that
are maintained by the Employer, shall be determined as if such Elective Deferrals (and, if applicable, such Qualified Nonelective
Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions, or both) were made under a single arrangement for purposes of determining such
"HCE's" actual deferral ratio. If an "HCE" participates in two or more arrangements described in Code Â§401(k) of the Employer that
have different plan years, all Elective Deferrals made during the Plan Year under all such arrangements shall be aggregated.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain plans shall be treated as separate if mandatorily disaggregated under Regulations under Code
Â§401(k).
(j) Disaggregation and otherwise excludable Employees. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, the provisions
of this Section and Section 12.5 may be applied separately (or will be applied separately to the extent required by Regulations) to each
"plan" within the meaning of Regulation Â§1.401(k)-6. Furthermore, the provisions of Code Â§401(k)(3)(F) may be used to exclude from
consideration all Nonhighly Compensated Employees who have not satisfied the minimum age and service requirements of Code
Â§410(a)(1)(A). For purposes of applying this provision, the Administrator may use any effective date of participation that is permitted
under Code Â§410(b) provided such date is applied on a consistent and uniform basis to all Participants.
(k) "HCEs" as sole Eligible Employees. If, for the applicable year for determining the ADP of the "NHCEs" for a Plan Year, there
are no eligible "NHCEs," then the Plan is deemed to satisfy the ADP test for the Plan Year.
12.5 ADJUSTMENT TO ACTUAL DEFERRAL PERCENTAGE TESTS
(a) Authority to correct. In the event the Plan does not satisfy one of the tests set forth in Section 12.4, the Administrator shall
adjust Excess Contributions or, if the current year testing method is being used, the Employer shall make contributions pursuant to the
options set forth below or any combination thereof.
(b) Corrective distribution and/or recharacterization. On or before the close of the following Plan Year (or with respect to
recharacterization as after-tax voluntary Employee contributions, on or before the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of
each Plan Year), the Highly Compensated Participant allocated the largest amount of Elective Deferrals shall have a portion of such
Elective Deferrals (and "income" allocable to such amounts) distributed (and/or, at the Participant's election, recharacterized as an
after-tax voluntary Employee contribution pursuant to Section 4.8) until the total amount of Excess Contributions has been distributed,
or until the amount of the Participant's Elective Deferrals equals the Elective Deferrals of the Highly Compensated Participant having
the next largest amount of Elective Deferrals allocated. This process shall continue until the total amount of Excess Contributions has
been distributed. However, in the event the Plan permits Catch-Up Contributions, then any "HCE" who is eligible to make Catch-Up
Contributions pursuant to Section 12.2(c) shall have any amount that would have otherwise been distributed pursuant to this Section
recharacterized as a Catch-Up Contribution (up to the maximum catch-up dollar limitation). Any distribution and/or recharacterization
of Excess Contributions shall be made in the following order:
(1) With respect to the distribution of Excess Contributions, such distribution:
(i) shall be made first from unmatched Elective Deferrals used in the ADP and, thereafter, simultaneously from such
Elective Deferrals which are matched and matching contributions which relate to such Elective Deferrals (if the matching
contributions are used in the ADP). Matching contributions which are not used in the ADP but which relate to Elective
Deferrals that are distributed pursuant to this Subsection shall be forfeited unless the related matching contributions are
distributed as Excess Aggregate Contributions pursuant to Section 12.7;
(ii) shall be made, as operationally determined by the Administrator, from the Participant's Pre-Tax Elective Deferral
Account or the Participant's Roth Elective Deferral Account, to the extent both Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective
Deferrals were made for the Plan Year;
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers
75

[PAGE 81]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(iii) shall be adjusted for "income"; and
(iv) shall be designated by the Employer as a distribution of Excess Contributions (and "income").
(2) With respect to the recharacterization of Excess Contributions as after-tax voluntary Employee contributions pursuant to (a)
above, such recharacterized amounts:
(i) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date on which the last of those Highly Compensated Participants with Excess
Contributions to be recharacterized is notified of the recharacterization and the tax consequences of such recharacterization;
(ii) shall not exceed the amount of Elective Deferrals on behalf of any Highly Compensated Participant for any Plan Year;
(iii) shall be treated as after-tax voluntary Employee contributions for purposes of Code Â§401(a)(4) and Regulation
Â§1.401(k)-1(b). However, for purposes of Sections 4.3(f) and 9.2 (top-heavy rules), recharacterized Excess Contributions
continue to be treated as Employer contributions that are Elective Deferrals. Excess Contributions (and "income"
attributable to such amounts) recharacterized as after-tax voluntary Employee contributions shall continue to be
nonforfeitable and subject to the same distribution rules provided for in Section 12.2(d); and
(iv) are not permitted if the amount recharacterized plus after-tax voluntary Employee contributions actually made by such
Highly Compensated Participant exceed the maximum amount of after-tax voluntary Employee contributions (determined
prior to application of Section 12.6) that such Highly Compensated Participant is permitted to make under the Plan in the
absence of recharacterization.
(3) Any distribution and/or recharacterization of less than the entire amount of Excess Contributions shall be treated as a pro
rata distribution and/or recharacterization of Excess Contributions and "income."
(4) For the purpose of this Section, "income" means the income or losses allocable to Excess Contributions, which amount shall
be determined and allocated, at the discretion of the Administrator, using any of the methods set forth below. The method must
be used consistently for all Participants and for all corrective distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year. The Administrator
will not calculate and distribute "income" for the period between the end of the Plan Year in which the Excess Contribution and
prior to the date of the distribution (the "gap period").
(i) Method of allocating "income." The Administrator may use any reasonable method for computing the "income"
allocable to Excess Contributions, provided that the method does not violate Code Â§401(a)(4), is used consistently for all
Participants and for all corrective distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year, and is used by the Plan for allocating
"income" to Participant's Accounts. A Plan will not fail to use a reasonable method for computing the "income" allocable to
Excess Contributions merely because the "income" allocable to Excess Contributions is determined on a date that is no more
than seven (7) days before the distribution.
(ii) Alternative method of allocating Plan Year income. The Administrator may allocate "income" to Excess
Contributions for the Plan Year by multiplying the "income" for the Plan Year allocable to the Elective Deferrals and other
amounts taken into account under this Section (including contributions made for the Plan Year), by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the Excess Contributions for the Employee for the Plan Year, and the denominator of which is the sum of the:
(A) Account balance attributable to Elective Deferrals and other contributions taken into account under this Section as
of the beginning of the Plan Year, and
(B) Any additional amount of such contributions made for the Plan Year.
(iii) Safe harbor method of allocating gap period income. The Administrator may use the safe harbor method in this
paragraph to determine "income" on Excess Contributions for the "gap period." Under this safe harbor method, "income" on
Excess Contributions for the "gap period" is equal to ten percent (10%) of the "income" allocable to Excess Contributions
for the Plan Year that would be determined under paragraph (ii) above, multiplied by the number of calendar months that
have elapsed since the end of the Plan Year. For purposes of calculating the number of calendar months that have elapsed
under the safe harbor method, a corrective distribution that is made on or before the fifteenth day of a month is treated as
made on the last day of the preceding month and a distribution made after the fifteenth day of a month is treated as made on
the last day of the month.
(iv) Alternative method for allocating Plan Year and gap period income. The Administrator may determine the
allocable gain or loss for the aggregate of the Plan Year and the "gap period" by applying the alternative method provided by
paragraph (ii) above to this aggregate period. This is accomplished by substituting the "income" for the Plan Year and the
"gap period" for the "income" for the Plan Year and by substituting the contributions taken into account under this Section
for the Plan Year and the "gap period" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year in
determining the fraction that is multiplied by that "income."

(5) Excess Contributions shall be treated as Employer contributions for purposes of Code Â§Â§404 and 415 even if distributed
from the Plan.
(c) Corrective contributions. Notwithstanding the above, if the current year testing method is used, then within twelve (12) months
after the end of the Plan Year, any corrective contribution must be determined in accordance with the formula stated at Question 41 on
the Adoption Agreement. If the prior year testing method is used, then a Qualified Nonelective Contribution and a Qualified Matching
Contribution may not be made to correct the tests set forth in Section 12.4. The Employer shall provide the Administrator with written
notification of the amount of the contribution being made. The term âNon-Highly Compensated Employeeâ shall mean, for this
purpose, a Non-Highly Compensated Employee taken into account for purposes of the (current-year) ADP Test.
(1) A Qualified Nonelective Contribution, if specified on the Adoption Agreement, shall be allocated to those Nonhighly
Compensated Employees specified on the Adoption Agreement in an amount sufficient to satisfy the ADP Test. As indicated on
the Adoption Agreement, such contribution shall be allocated in (1) the same dollar amount, or (2) in the proportion that each
Nonhighly Compensated Employee's 414(s) Compensation for the year bears to the total 414(s) Compensation of all Nonhighly
Compensated Employees for such year, or (3) using the âbottom-upâ method whereby such contribution shall be allocated to the
Qualified Nonelective Contribution Account of the Nonhighly Compensated Participant having the lowest 414(s) Compensation,
until the applicable ADP test set forth in Section 12.4 is satisfied, or until such Nonhighly Compensated Participant has received
the lesser of the maximum "annual addition" pursuant to Section 4.4 or the maximum that may be taken into account in the ADP
test pursuant to Section 12.4(g) (Targeted Contributions), continuing this process until one of the tests set forth in Section 12.4 is
satisfied.
(2) A Qualified Matching Contribution, if specified on the Adoption Agreement, shall be allocated to those Nonhighly
Compensated Employees specified on the Adoption Agreement in an amount sufficient to satisfy the ADP Test. As indicated on
the Adoption Agreement, such contribution shall be allocated in (1) the same dollar amount, or (2) in the proportion that each
Nonhighly Compensated Employee's Elective Deferrals for the year bears to the total Elective Deferrals of all Nonhighly
Compensated Employees for such year, or (3) using the âbottom-upâ method whereby such contribution shall be allocated to the
Qualified Matching Contribution Account of the Nonhighly Compensated Participant having the lowest 414(s) Compensation,
until the applicable ADP test set forth in Section 12.4 is satisfied, or until such Nonhighly Compensated Participant has received
the lesser of the maximum "annual addition" pursuant to Section 4.4 or the maximum that may be taken into account in the ADP
test pursuant to Section 12.4(g) (Targeted Contributions), continuing this process until one of the tests set forth in Section 12.4 is
satisfied.
(d) Disaggregation and otherwise excludable Employees. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, the provisions
of this Section 12.5 may be applied separately (or will be applied separately to the extent required by Regulations) to each "plan"
within the meaning of Regulation Â§1.401(k)-6. Furthermore, the provisions of Code Â§401(k)(3)(F) may be used to exclude from
consideration all Nonhighly Compensated Employees who have not satisfied the minimum age and service requirements of Code
Â§410(a)(1)(A). For purposes of applying this provision, the Administrator may use any effective date of participation that is permitted
under Code Â§410(b) provided such date is applied on a consistent and uniform basis to all Participants.
(e) Excise tax after 2 1/2 months (or 6 months). Any Excess Contributions (and "income") which are distributed after 2 1/2
months, or 6 months with respect to a Plan Year in which the EACA requirements of Section 12.2 are met, after the end of the Plan
Year are subject to a ten percent (10%) Employer excise tax imposed by Code Â§4979.
12.6 ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION PERCENTAGE TESTS
(a) ACP test. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Subsection applies if the prior year testing method is elected in the Adoption
Agreement. The "Actual Contribution Percentage" (hereinafter ACP) for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees
(hereinafter "HCEs") for each Plan Year and the prior year's ACP for Participants who were Nonhighly Compensated Employees
(hereinafter "NHCEs") for the prior Plan Year must satisfy one of the following tests:
(1) The ACP for a Plan Year for Participants who are "HCEs" for the Plan Year shall not exceed the prior year's ACP for
Participants who were "NHCEs" for the prior Plan Year multiplied by 1.25; or
(2) The ACP for a Plan Year for Participants who are "HCEs" for the Plan Year shall not exceed the prior year's ACP for
Participants who were "NHCEs" for the prior Plan Year multiplied by 2.0, provided that the ACP for Participants who are
"HCEs" does not exceed the prior year's ACP for Participants who were "NHCEs" in the prior Plan Year by more than two (2)
percentage points.
Notwithstanding the above, for purposes of applying the foregoing tests with respect to the first Plan Year (as defined in
Regulation Â§1.401(m)-2(c)(2)) in which the Plan permits any Participant to make "Employee contributions", provides for "matching
contributions", or both, the ACP for the prior year's "NHCEs" shall be the greater of three percent (3%) or the current Plan Year's ACP
for these Participants. However, the provisions of this paragraph may not be used if the Plan is a successor plan or is otherwise
prohibited from using such provisions pursuant to Regulation Â§1.401(m)-2(c)(2).

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(b) Current year testing method. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the current year testing method is elected in the Adoption
Agreement or if no election is made in the Adoption Agreement, and for any Plan Year for which the Employer has either reserved the
right to make a nonelective "ADP test safe harbor contribution" pursuant to Section 12.8 or amended the Plan to make an "ADP test
safe harbor contribution," the ACP tests in (a)(1) and (a)(2) above shall be applied by comparing the current Plan Year's ACP for
Participants who are "HCEs" with the current Plan Year's ACP (rather than the prior Plan Year's ACP) for Participants who are
"NHCEs" for the current Plan Year. Once made, the Employer can elect prior year testing for a Plan Year only if the Plan has used
current year testing for each of the preceding 5 Plan Years (or if lesser, the number of Plan Years the Plan has been in existence) or if,
as a result of a merger or acquisition described in Code Â§410(b)(6)(C)(i), the Employer maintains both a plan using prior year testing
and a plan using current year testing and the change is made within the transition period described in Code Â§410(b)(6)(C)(ii).
(c) Determination of "HCEs" and "NHCEs." A Participant is an "HCE" for a particular Plan Year if the Participant meets the
definition of an "HCE" in effect for that Plan Year. Similarly, a Participant is an "NHCE" for a particular Plan Year if the Participant
does not meet the definition of an "HCE" in effect for that Plan Year.
(d) Calculation of ACP. For the purposes of this Section and Section 12.7, ACP for a specific group of Participants for a Plan Year
means the average of the "contribution percentages" (calculated separately for each Participant in such group). For this purpose,
"contribution percentage" means the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the Participant's "contribution percentage amounts" to the
Participant's 414(s) Compensation. The actual contribution ratio for each Participant and the ACP for each group, shall be calculated
to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent of the Participant's 414(s) Compensation.
(e) Amounts included in ACP. "Contribution percentage amounts" means the sum of (1) after-tax voluntary Employee
contributions, (2) Employer "matching contributions" made pursuant to Section 12.1(a)(2) (including Qualified Matching
Contributions to the extent such Qualified Matching Contributions are not used to satisfy the tests set forth in Section 12.4), (3) Excess
Contributions recharacterized as nondeductible voluntary Employee contributions pursuant to Section 12.5, and (4) Qualified
Nonelective Contributions, to the extent the Qualified Nonelective Contributions are not used to satisfy the tests set forth in Section
12.4 and do not exceed the limitations of the targeted contribution limitation of Section 12.4(g). However, "contribution percentage
amounts" shall not include "matching contributions" that are forfeited either to correct Excess Aggregate Contributions or due to Code
Â§401(a)(4) and the Regulations thereunder because the contributions to which they relate are Excess Deferrals, Excess Contributions,
or Excess Aggregate Contributions. In addition, "contribution percentage amounts" may include Elective Deferrals provided the ADP
test in Section 12.4 is met before the Elective Deferrals are used in the ACP test and continues to be met following the exclusion of
those Elective Deferrals that are used to meet the ACP test.
(f) Participants taken into account. For purposes of this Section and Section 12.7, a Highly Compensated Participant and a
Nonhighly Compensated Participant shall include any Employee eligible to have "matching contributions" made pursuant to Section
12.1(a)(2) (whether or not a salary deferral election was made or suspended pursuant to the Plan) allocated to such Participant's
Account for the Plan Year or to make after-tax voluntary Employee contributions pursuant to Section 4.8 (whether or not after-tax
voluntary Employee contributions are made) allocated to the Participant's Account for the Plan Year.
(g) Allocations taken into account. For purposes of determining the ACP test, "Employee contributions" are considered to have
been made in the Plan Year in which contributed to the Plan. "Matching contributions" and Qualified Nonelective Contributions will
be considered made for a Plan Year if made no later than the end of the twelve (12) month period beginning on the date after the close
of the Plan Year. Excess Contributions recharacterized as after-tax voluntary Employee contributions pursuant to Section 12.5(b)(2)
are taken into account in the ACP for the Plan Year in which the contribution would have been received in cash if there had not been a
salary deferral election. A "matching contribution" will be taken into account in the ACP for a Plan Year only if (1) it is made on
account of the Participant's nondeductible voluntary "employee contributions" or on account of a Participant's Elective Deferrals under
a plan maintained by the Employer for that Plan Year and (2) it is allocated to the Participant's Account as of any date within that Plan
Year.
(h) Definition of "matching contribution" and "employee contribution." For purposes of this Section and Section 12.7,
"matching contribution" means an Employer contribution made to the Plan, or to a contract described in Code Â§403(b), on behalf of a
Participant on account of a nondeductible voluntary "employee contribution" made by such Participant, or on account of a
Participant's elective deferrals under a plan maintained by the Employer. "Employee contribution" means any contribution (other than
Roth Elective Deferrals) made to the Plan by or on behalf of a Participant that is included in the Participant's gross income in the year
in which made and that is maintained under separate account to which earnings and losses are allocated.
(i) Targeted matching contributions. Notwithstanding the preceding, a "matching contribution" with respect to an Elective
Deferral for a year is not taken into account in determining the ACP for "NHCEs" to the extent it exceeds the greatest of:
(1) five percent (5%) of the Participant's 414(s) Compensation for the year;
(2) the Employee's Elective Deferrals for the year; or
(3) the product of two (2) times the Plan's "representative matching rate" and the Participant's Elective Deferrals for the year.

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
For purposes of this Subsection, the Plan's "representative matching rate" is the lowest "matching rate" for any eligible "NHCE"
among a group of "NHCEs" that consists of half of all eligible "NHCEs" in the Plan for the Plan Year who make Elective Deferrals
for the Plan Year (or, if greater, the lowest "matching rate" for all eligible "NHCEs" in the Plan who are employed by the Employer on
the last day of the Plan Year and who make Elective Deferrals for the Plan Year).
For purposes of this Subsection, the "matching rate" for an Employee generally is the "matching contributions" made for such
Employee divided by the Employee's Elective Deferrals for the year. If the "matching rate" is not the same for all levels of Elective
Deferrals for an Employee, the Employee's "matching rate" is determined assuming that an Employee's Elective Deferrals are equal to
six percent (6%) of 414(s) Compensation.
If the Plan provides a match with respect to the sum of the Employee's after-tax voluntary Employee contributions and Elective
Deferrals, then for purposes of this Subsection, that sum is substituted for the amount of the Employee's Elective Deferrals and
Employees who make either after-tax voluntary Employee contributions or Elective Deferrals are taken into account in determining
the Plan's "representative matching rate." Similarly, if the Plan provides a match with respect to the Employee's after-tax voluntary
Employee contributions, but not Elective Deferrals, then for purposes of this Subsection, the Employee's after-tax voluntary Employee
contributions are substituted for the amount of the Employee's Elective Deferrals and Employees who make after-tax voluntary
Employee contributions are taken into account in determining the Plan's "representative matching rate."
(j) Aggregation with other plans. In the event that this Plan satisfies the requirements of Code Â§401(a)(4), 401(m), or 410(b) only
if aggregated with one or more other plans, or if one or more other plans satisfy the requirements of such sections of the Code only if
aggregated with this Plan, then this Section shall be applied by determining the ACP of Employees as if all such plans were a single
plan. If more than ten percent (10%) of the Employer's "NHCEs" are involved in a plan coverage change as defined in Regulation
Â§1.401(m)-2(c)(4), then any adjustments to the "NHCE's" ACP for the prior year will be made in accordance with such Regulations, if
the Employer has elected in the Adoption Agreement to use the prior year testing method. Plans may be aggregated in order to satisfy
Code Â§401(m) only if they have the same Plan Year and use the same ACP testing method.
(k) ACP if multiple plans. For the purposes of this Section, if an HCE is a Participant under two (2) or more plans (other than an
employee stock ownership plan as defined in Code Â§4975(e)(7)) which are maintained by the Employer or an Affiliated Employer to
which "matching contributions," nondeductible voluntary Employee contributions, or both, are made, all such contributions on behalf
of such HCE shall be aggregated for purposes of determining such HCE's actual contribution ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
certain plans shall be treated as separate if mandatorily disaggregated under Regulations under Code Â§401(m).
(l) Disaggregation and otherwise excludable Employees. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, the provisions
of this Section and Section 12.7 may be applied separately (or will be applied separately to the extent required by Regulations) to each
"plan" within the meaning of Regulation Â§1.401(m)-5. Furthermore, the provisions of Code Â§401(m)(5)(C) may be used to exclude
from consideration all Nonhighly Compensated Employees who have not satisfied the minimum age and service requirements of Code
Â§410(a)(1)(A). For purposes of applying this provision, the Administrator may use any effective date of participation that is permitted
under Code Â§410(a) provided such date is applied on a consistent and uniform basis to all Participants.
(m) "HCEs" as sole Eligible Employees. If, for the applicable year for determining the ACP of the "NHCEs" for a Plan Year, there
are no eligible "NHCEs," then the Plan is deemed to satisfy the ACP test for the Plan Year.
12.7 ADJUSTMENT TO ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION PERCENTAGE TESTS
(a) Authority to correct. In the event the Plan does not satisfy one of the tests set forth in Section 12.6, the Administrator shall
adjust Excess Aggregate Contributions or, if the current year testing method is used, the Employer shall make contributions pursuant
to the options set forth below or any combination thereof.
(b) Corrective distribution or Forfeiture. On or before the close of the following Plan Year, the Highly Compensated Participant
having the largest allocation of "contribution percentage amounts" shall have a portion of such "contribution percentage amounts"
(and "income" allocable to such amounts) distributed or, if non-Vested, Forfeited (including "income" allocable to such Forfeitures)
until the total amount of Excess Aggregate Contributions has been distributed, or until the amount of the Participant's "contribution
percentage amounts" equals the "contribution percentage amounts" of the Highly Compensated Participant having the next largest
amount of "contribution percentage amounts." This process shall continue until the total amount of Excess Aggregate Contributions
has been distributed or forfeited. Any distribution and/or Forfeiture of "contribution percentage amounts" shall be made in the
following order:
(1) Employer "matching contributions" distributed and/or forfeited pursuant to Section 12.5(b)(1);
(2) After-tax voluntary Employee contributions including Excess Contributions recharacterized as after-tax voluntary Employee
contributions pursuant to Section 12.5(b)(2);
(3) Unmatched Elective Deferrals used in the ACP and, thereafter, simultaneously from such Elective Deferrals used in the
ACP which are matched and "matching contributions" which relate to such Elective Deferrals (if the "matching contributions" are

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
used in the ACP). "Matching contributions" which are not used in the ACP but which relate to Elective Deferrals that are
distributed to Highly Compensated Participants pursuant to this Subsection shall be forfeited unless the related "matching
contributions" are distributed as Excess Aggregate Contributions pursuant to this Subsection;
(4) To the extent Elective Deferrals are distributed pursuant to the preceding paragraph, then the distribution shall be made, as
operationally determined by the Administrator, from the Participant's Pre-Tax Elective Deferral Account or the Participant's Roth
Elective Deferral Account, to the extent both Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals were made for the Plan
Year, to the extent both Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals were made for the Plan Year; and
(5) Remaining Employer "matching contributions."
(c) Source of corrective distribution or Forfeiture. Any distribution or Forfeiture of less than the entire amount of Excess
Aggregate Contributions (and "income") shall be treated as a pro rata distribution of Excess Aggregate Contributions and "income."
Distribution of Excess Aggregate Contributions shall be designated by the Employer as a distribution of Excess Aggregate
Contributions (and "income"). Forfeitures of Excess Aggregate Contributions shall be treated in accordance with Section 4.3.
However, no such Forfeiture may be allocated to a Highly Compensated Participant whose contributions are reduced pursuant to this
Section.
(d) Determination of income or loss. For the purpose of this Section, "income" means the income or losses allocable to Excess
Aggregate Contributions, which amount shall be determined and allocated, at the discretion of the Administrator, using any of the
methods set forth in Section 12.5(b)(4) with respect to the calculation of "income" for Excess Contributions (applied by substituting
Excess Contributions with Excess Aggregate Contributions and by substituting amounts taken into account under the ACP test for
amounts taken into account under the ADP test in Section 12.4). However, the Administrator will not calculate and distribute
"income" for the period between the end of the Plan Year in which the Excess Aggregate Contribution and prior to the date of the
distribution (the "gap period").
(e) Treatment of excess amounts. Excess Aggregate Contributions attributable to amounts other than nondeductible voluntary
Employee contributions, including forfeited "matching contributions," shall be treated as Employer contributions for purposes of Code
Â§Â§404 and 415 even if distributed from the Plan.
(f) Ordering of tests. The determination of the amount of Excess Aggregate Contributions with respect to any Plan Year shall be
made after first determining the Excess Contributions, if any, to be treated as nondeductible voluntary Employee contributions due to
recharacterization for the Plan Year of any other qualified cash or deferred arrangement (as defined in Code Â§401(k)) maintained by
the Employer that ends with or within the Plan Year or which are treated as after-tax voluntary Employee contributions due to
recharacterization pursuant to Section 12.5.
(g) Corrective contributions. Notwithstanding the above, if the current year testing method is being used, then within twelve (12)
months after the end of the Plan Year, any corrective contribution must be determined in accordance with the formula stated at
Question 41 on the Adoption Agreement. If the prior year testing method is used, then a Qualified Nonelective Contribution or an
Employer "matching contribution" may not be made to correct the tests set forth in Section 12.6. The Employer shall provide the
Administrator with written notification of the amount of the contribution being made and to which provision it relates. The term âNon-
Highly Compensated Employeeâ shall mean, for this purpose, a Non-Highly Compensated Employee taken into account for purposes
of the (current-year) ACP Test.
(1) A Qualified Nonelective Contribution, if specified on the Adoption Agreement, shall be allocated to those Nonhighly
Compensated Employees specified on the Adoption Agreement in an amount sufficient to satisfy the ACP Test. As indicated on
the Adoption Agreement, such contribution shall be allocated in (1) the same dollar amount, or (2) in the proportion that each
Nonhighly Compensated Employee's 414(s) Compensation for the year bears to the total 414(s) Compensation of all Nonhighly
Compensated Employees for such year, or (3) using the âbottom-upâ method whereby such contribution shall be allocated to the
Qualified Nonelective Contribution Account of the Nonhighly Compensated Participant having the lowest 414(s) Compensation,
until the applicable ACP test set forth in Section 12.7 is satisfied, or until such Nonhighly Compensated Participant has received
the lesser of the maximum "annual addition" pursuant to Section 4.4 or the maximum that may be taken into account in the ACP
test pursuant to Section 12.4(g) (Targeted Contributions), continuing this process until one of the tests set forth in Section 12.7 is
satisfied.
(2) A Qualified Matching Contribution, if specified on the Adoption Agreement, shall be allocated to those Nonhighly
Compensated Employees specified on the Adoption Agreement in an amount sufficient to satisfy the ACP Test. As indicated on
the Adoption Agreement, such contribution shall be allocated in (1) the same dollar amount, or (2) in the proportion that each
Nonhighly Compensated Employee's Elective Deferrals for the year bears to the total Elective Deferrals of all Nonhighly
Compensated Employees for such year, or (3) using the âbottom-upâ method whereby such contribution shall be allocated to the
Qualified Matching Contribution Account of the Nonhighly Compensated Participant having the lowest 414(s) Compensation,
until the applicable ACP test set forth in Section 12.7 is satisfied, or until such Nonhighly Compensated Participant has received
the lesser of the maximum "annual addition" pursuant to Section 4.4 or the maximum that may be taken into account in the ACP

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
test pursuant to Section 12.4(g) (Targeted Contributions), continuing this process until one of the tests set forth in Section 12.7 is
satisfied.
(3) A Matching Contribution (not a QMAC), if specified on the Adoption Agreement, shall be allocated to those Nonhighly
Compensated Employees specified on the Adoption Agreement in an amount sufficient to satisfy the ACP Test. As indicated on
the Adoption Agreement, such contribution shall be allocated in (1) the same dollar amount, or (2) in the proportion that each
Nonhighly Compensated Employee's Elective Deferrals for the year bears to the total Elective Deferrals of all Nonhighly
Compensated Employees for such year, or (3) using the âbottom-upâ method whereby such contribution shall be allocated to the
Qualified Matching Contribution Account of the Nonhighly Compensated Participant having the lowest 414(s) Compensation,
until the applicable ACP test set forth in Section 12.7 is satisfied, or until such Nonhighly Compensated Participant has received
the lesser of the maximum "annual addition" pursuant to Section 4.4 or the maximum that may be taken into account in the ACP
test pursuant to Section 12.7(i) (Targeted Contributions), continuing this process until one of the tests set forth in Section 12.7 is
satisfied.
(h) Disaggregation and otherwise excludable Employees. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, the provisions
of this Section 12.7 may be applied separately (or will be applied separately to the extent required by Regulations) to each "plan"
within the meaning of Regulation Â§1.401(k)-6. Furthermore, the provisions of Code Â§401(k)(3)(F) may be used to exclude from
consideration all Nonhighly Compensated Employees who have not satisfied the minimum age and service requirements of Code
Â§410(a)(1)(A). For purposes of applying this provision, the Administrator may use any effective date of participation that is permitted
under Code Â§410(b) provided such date is applied on a consistent and uniform basis to all Participants.
(i) Excise tax after 2 1/2 months (or 6 months). Any Excess Aggregate Contributions (and "income") which are distributed after
2 1/2 months, or 6 months with respect to a Plan Year in which the EACA requirements of Section 12.2(b) are met, after the end of the
Plan Year shall be subject to the ten percent (10%) Employer excise tax imposed by Code Â§4979.
12.8 401(k) ADP TEST SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS
(a) Election of "ADP test safe harbor." The provisions of this Section will apply if the Employer has elected, in the 401(k) ADP
Test Safe Harbor Provisions Section of the Adoption Agreement, to use the "ADP test safe harbor" or "ACP test safe harbor." If the
Employer has elected to use the "ADP test safe harbor" for a Plan Year, then the provisions relating to the ADP test described in
Section 12.4 and in Code Â§401(k)(3) do not apply for such Plan Year to the group of Participants subject to the "ADP test safe harbor"
provisions. In addition, if the Employer has also elected to use the "ACP test safe harbor" for a Plan Year, then the provisions relating
to the ACP test described in Section 12.6 and in Code Â§401(m)(2) do not apply for such Plan Year to the group of Participants subject
to the "ACP test safe harbor" provisions. Furthermore, to the extent any other provision of the Plan is inconsistent with the provisions
of this Section, the provisions of this Section will govern. In accordance with Regulation Â§1.401(k)-1(e)(7) and Regulation Â§1.401(m)-
1(c)(2), it is impermissible for the Employer to use the ADP test or the ACP test for a Plan Year in which it is intended for the Plan,
through its written terms, to use the "ADP test safe harbor" or "ACP test safe harbor" and the Employer fails to satisfy the
requirements of such safe harbors for the Plan Year.
(b) Definitions. For purposes of this Section and Section 12.9, the following definitions apply:
(1) "ACP test safe harbor" means the method described in Subsection (d) below for satisfying the ACP test of Code Â§401(m)(2).
(2) "ACP test safe harbor matching contributions" means "matching contributions" described in Subsection (d)(1).
(3) "ADP test safe harbor" means the method described in Subsection (c) for satisfying the ADP test of Code Â§401(k)(3).
(4) "ADP test safe harbor contributions" means the contributions made pursuant to Subsection (c)(1) below.
(5) "Compensation" means Compensation as defined in Section 1.18, except, for purposes of this Section, no dollar limit, other
than the limit imposed by Code Â§401(a)(17), applies to the Compensation of a Nonhighly Compensated Employee.
(6) "Eligible Participant" means a Participant who is eligible to make Elective Deferrals under the Plan for any part of the Plan
Year (or who would be eligible to make Elective Deferrals but for a suspension due to a hardship distribution described in
Section 12.10 or to statutory limitations, such as Code Â§Â§402(g) and 415) and who is not excluded as an "eligible Participant" in
the 401(k) ADP Test Safe Harbor Provisions Section of the Adoption Agreement.
(7) "Matching contributions" means contributions made by the Employer on account of an "eligible Participant's" Elective
Deferrals.
(c) Satisfying ADP safe harbor. The provisions of this Subsection apply for purposes of satisfying the "ADP test safe harbor."
(1) The "ADP test safe harbor contribution" is the contribution, elected by the Employer in the 401(k) ADP Test Safe Harbor
Provisions Section of the Adoption Agreement, to be used to satisfy the "ADP test safe harbor." However, if no contribution is

[PAGE 87]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
elected in the Adoption Agreement, the Employer will contribute to the Plan for the Plan Year a "basic matching contribution" on
behalf of each Eligible Employee. The "basic matching contribution" is equal to (i) one hundred percent (100%) of the amount of
an "eligible Participant's" Elective Deferrals that do not exceed three percent (3%) of the Participant's "Compensation" for the
Plan Year, plus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the Participant's Elective Deferrals that exceed three percent (3%) of the
Participant's "Compensation" but do not exceed five percent (5%) of the Participant's "Compensation." However, if the
contribution is being made pursuant to a QACA as described in Section 12.9, then the "basic matching contribution" is equal to
(i) one hundred percent (100%) of the amount of an "eligible Participant's" Elective Deferrals that do not exceed one percent
(1%) of the Participant's "Compensation" for the Plan Year, plus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the Participant's
Elective Deferrals that exceed one percent (1%) of the Participant's "Compensation" but do not exceed six percent (6%) of the
Participant's "Compensation." If pursuant to this Section, the "ADP test safe harbor contribution" being made to the Plan
(including a contribution being made pursuant to a QACA as described in Section 12.9) is a matching contribution that is made
on a basis other than the Plan Year, then the matching contributions must be contributed to the Plan by the last day of the Plan
Year quarter immediately following the Plan Year quarter to which the contributions relate.
(2) Except as provided in Subsection (e) below, for purposes of the Plan, a "basic matching contribution" or an "enhanced
matching contribution" will be treated as a Qualified Matching Contribution and a nonelective "ADP test safe harbor
contribution" will be treated as a Qualified Nonelective Contribution. Accordingly, "ADP test safe harbor contributions" will be
fully Vested and subject to the distribution restrictions set forth in Section 12.2(e) other than on account of a hardship (i.e., may
generally not be distributed earlier than severance of employment, death, Total and Permanent Disability, an event described in
Code Â§401(k)(10), or, in case of a profit sharing plan, the attainment of age 59 1/2.). In addition, such contributions must satisfy
the "ADP test safe harbor" without regard to permitted disparity under Code Â§401(l). An "enhanced matching contribution" is a
matching contribution that, at rate of Elective Deferrals, is at least equal to what the matching contribution would be if under the
"basic matching contribution."
(3) Notwithstanding the requirement that the Employer make the "ADP test safe harbor contribution" to this Plan, if the
Employer so elects in the Adoption Agreement, the "ADP test safe harbor contribution" will be made to the defined contribution
plan indicated in the Adoption Agreement. However, such contributions will be made to this Plan unless (i) each Employee
eligible under this Plan is also eligible under the other plan, and (ii) the other plan has the same Plan Year as this Plan.
(4) Within a reasonable period before the beginning of the Plan Year (or, in the year an Eligible Employee becomes a
Participant, within a reasonable period before the Employee becomes eligible), the Employer will provide each "eligible
Participant" a comprehensive notice of the Participant's rights and obligations under the Plan, written in a manner calculated to be
understood by the average Participant. The determination of whether a notice satisfies the timing requirement of this paragraph is
based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. However, the timing requirement of the notice is deemed to be satisfied if at
least thirty (30) days, but not more than ninety (90) days, before the beginning of the Plan Year, the Employer will provide each
"eligible Participant" a comprehensive notice of the Participant's rights and obligations under the Plan, written in a manner
calculated to be understood by the average Participant. However, if an Employee becomes eligible after the 90th day before the
beginning of the Plan Year and does not receive the notice for that reason, the notice must be provided no more than ninety (90)
days before the Employee becomes eligible but not later than the date the Employee becomes eligible.
(5) In addition to any other election periods provided under the Plan, each "eligible Participant" may make or modify a salary
deferral election during the thirty (30) day period immediately following receipt of the notice described in Subsection (4) above.
Furthermore, if the "ADP test safe harbor contribution" is a "matching contribution" each Eligible Employee must be permitted to
elect sufficient Elective Deferrals to receive the maximum amount of "matching contributions" available to the Participant under
the Plan.
(d) Application of "ACP test safe harbor." The provisions of this Subsection apply if the Employer has elected to satisfy the "ACP
test safe harbor."
(1) In addition to the "ADP test safe harbor contributions," the Employer will make any "matching contributions" in accordance
with elections made in the Adoption Agreement. Such additional "matching contributions" will be considered "ACP test safe
harbor matching contributions." "Matching contributions" are taken into account for a Plan Year purposes of the "ACP test safe
harbor" in accordance with the allocation and timing rules of Regulation Â§1.401(m)-2(a), which provides that a matching
contribution will be taken into account for a Plan Year only if (1) it is made on account of the Participant's nondeductible
voluntary "employee contributions" or elective deferrals under a plan maintained by the Employer for that Plan Year and (2) it is
allocated to the Participant's account as of any date within that Plan Year, and (3) it is actually paid to the plan no later than
twelve (12) months after the close of the Plan Year.
(2) Notwithstanding any election in the Adoption Agreement to the contrary, (1) an "eligible Participant's" Elective Deferrals in
excess of six percent (6%) of "Compensation" may not be taken into account in applying "ACP test safe harbor matching
contributions," (2) In addition, any portion of an "ACP test safe harbor matching contribution" attributable to a discretionary
"matching contribution" may not exceed four percent (4%) of an "eligible Participant's" "Compensation," (3) the rate of match
may not increase as the rate of Elective Deferrals increases; and (4) any Participant who is a Highly Compensated Employee may

Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
not receive a rate of match that is greater than any Non-Highly Compensated Participant deferring the same amount (as a
percentage of Compensation).
(e) Application of ACP test. The Plan is required to satisfy the ACP test of Code Â§401(m)(2), using the current year testing method,
if the Plan permits after-tax voluntary Employee contributions or if matching contributions that do not satisfy the "ACP test safe
harbor" may be made to the Plan. In such event, only "ADP test safe harbor contributions" or "ACP test safe harbor contributions" that
exceed the amount needed to satisfy the "ADP test safe harbor" or "ACP test safe harbor" (if the Employer has elected to use the
"ACP test safe harbor") may be treated as Qualified Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions in applying the
ACP test. In addition, in applying the ACP test, elective contributions may not be treated as "matching contributions" under Code
Â§401(m)(3). Furthermore, in applying the ACP test, the Employer may operationally elect to disregard with respect to all "eligible
Participants" (1) all "matching contributions" if the Plan satisfies the "ACP test safe harbor" and (2) "matching contributions" that do
not exceed four percent (4%) (3 1/2% if a QACA) of each Participant's "Compensation" if the Plan satisfies the "ADP test safe harbor"
using "matching contributions" (the "basic matching contribution" or the "enhanced matching contribution") and the "ACP test safe
harbor" is not satisfied.
(f) Modification of top-heavy rules. The top-heavy requirements of Code Â§416 and the Plan shall not apply in any Plan Year in
which the Plan consists solely of a cash or deferred arrangement which meets the requirements of Code Â§401(k)(12) and "matching
contributions" with respect to which the requirements of Code Â§401(m)(11) are met.
(g) Plan Year requirement. Except as provided in Regulation Â§1.401(k)-3(e), the Plan will fail to satisfy the requirements of Code
Â§401(k)(12) and this Section for a Plan Year unless such provisions remain in effect for an entire twelve (12) month Plan Year.
(h) Discretionary safe harbor nonelective contribution. If the Employer has elected in the Adoption Agreement to either not use
the 401(k) safe harbor provisions of this Section or to utilize the "maybe" election with respect to the nonelective "ADP test safe
harbor contribution," then the Employer may elect to utilize the "ADP test safe harbor" provisions for a Plan Year after the Plan Year
has commenced in accordance with the provisions of this Subsection. In order to utilize this Subsection, the Employer must provide a
notice in accordance with Section 12.8(c)(4) above, except that the notice must provide that the Employer may provide the nonelective
"ADP test safe harbor contribution" and that a supplemental notice will be provided at least thirty (30) days prior to the last day of the
Plan Year if the Employer decides to make the nonelective "ADP test safe harbor contribution". In order to implement the 401(k) safe
harbor provisions of this Section for the Plan Year, the Employer must (1) amend the Adoption Agreement to provide for the
nonelective "ADP test safe harbor contribution" and, (2) provide a supplemental notice to Participants indicating its intention to
provide such nonelective "ADP test safe harbor contribution". The supplemental notice indicating the Employer's intention to make
the nonelective "ADP test safe harbor contribution" must be provided no later than thirty (30) days prior to the last day of the Plan
Year for the Plan in order for the provisions of this Section to apply.
(i) Elimination of safe harbor contributions or matching contributions. The Employer may amend the Plan during a Plan Year
to reduce or eliminate "ADP test safe harbor contributions" or matching contributions for such Plan Year subject to the following
provisions.
(1) An amendment may be made during a Plan Year to reduce or eliminate prospectively any or all "ADP test safe harbor
contributions" provided a supplemental notice is given to all "eligible Participants" explaining the consequences and effective
date of the amendment, and that such "eligible Participants" have a reasonable opportunity (including a reasonable period) to
change their Elective Deferral (and if applicable, their Voluntary Employee Contribution) elections. An amendment reducing or
eliminating an "ADP test safe harbor contribution" must be effective no earlier than the later of: (i) thirty (30) days after "eligible
Participants" are given the supplemental notice or (ii) the date the amendment is adopted. If the Employer amends the Plan to
reduce or eliminate the "ADP test safe harbor contributions," then except as provided in Code Â§Â§401(k) and 401(m) and the
Regulations thereunder, the Plan is subject to the ADP test set forth in Section 12.4 and the ACP test set forth in Section 12.6 for
the entire Plan Year using current year testing and the Employer must also satisfy the provisions of this Section 12.8 until the
amendment becomes effective.
(2) Notwithstanding the preceding, an amendment may be made during a Plan Year to eliminate a nonelective "ADP test safe
harbor contribution" for such Plan Year only in accordance with the provisions of Regulation Â§1.401(k)-3(g) and, if applicable,
Regulation Â§1.401(m)-3(h)).
(3) If the Employer eliminates a matching contribution that is not an "ADP test safe harbor contribution," then the "ADP test
safe harbor" provisions of this Section continue to apply (i.e., the provisions relating to the ADP test described in Section 12.4
and in Code Â§401(k)(3) do not apply for such Plan Year to the group of Participants subject to the "ADP test safe harbor"
provisions).

(j) Mid-year amendments. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, effective for mid-year amendments adopted
after January 28, 2016, the Employer may amend the Plan effective on a date other than the first day of the Plan Year, or with a
retroactive effective date, so long as the amendment complies with IRS Notice 2016-16 and other IRS Guidance. For permissible mid-
year Plan changes impacting a Planâs required safe harbor notice content, a notice will be provided to all Eligible Employees pursuant
to IRS Notice 2016-16 or any later IRS Guidance.
Each employee required to be provided an updated safe harbor notice pursuant to Notice 2016-16 must be given a reasonable opportunity
(including a reasonable period after receipt of the updated notice) before the effective date of the mid-year change to change the employee's
cash or deferred election (and/or any after-tax employee contribution election). For this purpose, a 30-day election period is deemed to be a
reasonable period to make or change a cash or deferred election. If it is not practicable for the election opportunity to be provided before
the effective date of the change (for example, in the case of a mid-year change to increase matching contributions retroactively for the
entire plan year), an employee is treated as having a reasonable opportunity to make or change an election if the election opportunity begins
as soon as practicable after the date the updated notice is provided to the employee, but not later than 30 days after the date the change is
adopted.
12.9 QUALIFIED AUTOMATIC CONTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENT
(a) Qualified Automatic Contribution Arrangement (QACA). If elected in the Adoption Agreement, the Employer maintains a
Plan with Automatic Deferral provisions as a Qualified Automatic Contribution Arrangement (QACA) and the provisions of this
Section will apply. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the Plan's "ADP test safe harbor" and "ACP test safe harbor"
provisions set forth in Section 12.8 apply. The Employer will contribute on behalf of the Participants specified in the Adoption
Agreement, "ADP test safe harbor contributions," as elected in the Adoption Agreement.
(b) Participants subject to the QACA. The Employer in its Adoption Agreement will elect which Participants are subject to the
QACA Automatic Deferral on the "QACA Effective Date" thereof which may include some or all current Participants or may be
limited to those Employees who become Participants after the "QACA Effective Date." The "QACA Effective Date" means the date
on which the QACA goes into effect, either as to the overall Plan or as to an individual Participants as the context requires. A QACA
becomes effective as to the Plan as of the date the Employer elects in the Adoption Agreement. A Participant's "QACA Effective
Date" is as soon as practicable after the Participant is subject to Automatic Deferrals under the QACA, consistent with: (A) applicable
law; and (B) the objective of affording the Participant a reasonable period of time after receipt of the QACA notice to make an
Affirmative Election (and, if applicable, an investment election).
(c) QACA Automatic Deferral amount. Except as provided in Subsection (d) below (relating to uniformity requirements), the Plan
must apply to all Participants subject to the QACA, a uniform Automatic Deferral amount, as a percentage of each Participant's
Compensation, which does not exceed ten percent (10%), and which is at least the following minimum amount:
(1) Initial period. 3% for the period that begins when the Participant first has contributions made pursuant to a default election
under the QACA and ends on the last day of the following Plan Year;
(2) Third Plan Year. 4% for the third Plan Year of the Participant's participation in the QACA;
(3) Fourth Plan Year. 5% for the fourth Plan Year of the Participant's participation in the QACA; and
(4) Fifth and later Plan Years. 6% for the fifth Plan Year of the Participant's participation in the QACA and for each
subsequent Plan Year.
For purposes of the above, the Plan will treat an Employee who for an entire Plan Year did not have contributions made
pursuant to a default election under the QACA as not having made such contributions for any prior Plan Year.
(d) Uniformity. The "Automatic Deferral Percentage" must be a uniform percentage of Compensation. The "Automatic Deferral
Percentage" is the percentage of Automatic Deferral which the Employer elects in the Adoption Agreement (including any scheduled
increase to the "Automatic Deferral Percentage"). However, the Plan does not violate the uniform "Automatic Deferral Percentage"
merely because:
(1) Years of participation. The "Automatic Deferral Percentage" varies based on the number of Plan Years the Participant has
participated in the Plan while the Plan has applied the QACA provisions;
(2) No reduction from prior default percentage. The Plan does not reduce an "Automatic Deferral Percentage" that,
immediately prior to the QACA's effective date was higher (for any Participant) than the "Automatic Deferral Percentage."
(3) Applying statutory limits. The Plan limits the Automatic Deferral amount so as not to exceed the limits of Code
Â§401(a)(17), 402(g) (determined without regard to Catch-Up Contributions), or 415;

(4) No Automatic Deferrals during hardship suspension. The Plan does not apply the Automatic Deferral during a period of
suspension, under the Plan's hardship distribution provisions, of Participant's right to make Elective Deferrals to the Plan
following a hardship distribution; or
(5) Disaggregated groups. The Plan applies different default percentages to different groups if the groups can be disaggregated
under Regulation Â§1.401(k)-1(b)(4).
(e) Safe harbor notice. The Plan's safe harbor notice provisions apply as set forth in Section 12.8, except the Employer must
provide the initial QACA safe harbor notice sufficiently early so that an Employee has a reasonable period after receiving the notice
and before the first Automatic Deferral to make an Affirmative Election. In addition, the notice must state: (1) the Automatic Deferral
amount that will apply in absence of the Employee's Affirmative Election; (2) the Employee's right to elect not to have any Automatic
Deferral amount made on the Employee's behalf or to elect to make Elective Deferrals in a different amount or percentage of
Compensation; and (iii) how the Plan will invest the Automatic Deferrals. However, if it is not practicable for the notice to be
provided on or before the date an Employee becomes a Participant, then the notice nonetheless will be treated as provided timely if it
is provided as soon as practicable after that date and the Employee is permitted to elect to defer from all types of Compensation that
may be deferred under the Plan earned beginning on that date. For this purpose, the Administrator is deemed to provide timely notice
if the Administrator provides the notice at least thirty (30) days and not more than ninety (90) days prior to the beginning of the
QACA Plan Year.
(f) Distributions. A Participant's Account balance attributable to QACA "ADP test safe harbor contributions" is subject to the
distribution restrictions set forth in Section 12.2(e) other than on account of a hardship (i.e., may generally not be distributed earlier
than severance of employment, death, Total and Permanent Disability, an event described in Code Â§401(k)(10), or, in case of a profit
sharing plan, the attainment of age 59 1/2).
(g) Vesting. A Participant's Account balance attributable to QACA "ADP test safe harbor contributions" is Vested in accordance
with the vesting schedule, if any, elected in the Adoption Agreement.
(h) Compensation. Compensation for purposes of determining the "Automatic Deferral Percentage" has the same meaning as
Compensation with regard to Elective Deferrals.
(i) Modification of top-heavy rules. The top-heavy requirements of Code Â§416 and the Plan shall not apply in any Plan Year in
which the Plan consists solely of a cash or deferred arrangement which meets the requirements of Code Â§401(k)(13) and "matching
contributions" with respect to which the requirements of Code Â§401(m)(12) is met.
12.10 DISTRIBUTION FOR HARDSHIP
(a) Hardship events. If elected in the Adoption Agreement, the Administrator, at the election of a Participant, shall direct the
Trustee (or Insurer) to distribute to the Participant in any one Plan Year up to an amount necessary to satisfy the Participantâs
immediate and heavy financial need, determined in accordance with the remaining provisions of this Section. Distribution of Elective
Deferrals (and any earnings credited to a participant's Elective Deferral and Qualified Matching and Qualified Nonelective accounts as
of the later of December 31, 1988, and or the end of the last Plan Year ending before July 1, 1989) may be made to a Participant in the
event of hardship. A hardship distribution may only be made on account of an immediate and heavy financial need of the Participant
and where the distribution is necessary to satisfy the immediate and heavy financial need. Except for when the provisions of Section
6.13 apply, hardship distributions are subject to the spousal consent requirements contained in the provisions of this Plan which reflect
the requirements of Code Â§Â§ 401(a)(11) and 417. Such distributions may also be made from those Accounts from which such
distribution are authorized by the remaining provisions of this Section. For purposes of this Section, a Participant shall include an
Employee (or if elected in the Adoption Agreement, a former employee) who has an Account balance in the Plan. Any distribution
made pursuant to this Section shall be deemed to be made as of the first day of the Plan Year or, if later, the Valuation Date
immediately preceding the date of distribution, and the Account from which the distribution is made shall be reduced accordingly. A
withdrawal under this Section shall be authorized only if the distribution is for one of the following or any other item permitted under
Regulation Â§1.401(k)-1(d)(3)(iii)(B) or any other federally enacted legislation (the Administrator operationally and in a
nondiscriminatory manner may limit the deemed immediate and heavy financial need events to only certain of the events specified
below):
(1) expenses for (or necessary to obtain) medical care (as defined in Code Â§213(d));
(2) costs directly related to the purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a principal residence for the Participant;
(3) payments for burial or funeral expenses for the Participant's deceased parent, Spouse, children or dependents (as defined in
Code Â§152, and without regard to Code Â§152(d)(1)(B));
(4) payment of tuition, related educational fees, and room and board expenses, for up to the next twelve (12) months of
post-secondary education for the Participant, the Participant's Spouse, children, or dependents (as defined in Code Â§152, and
without regard to Code Â§152(b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B));

[PAGE 91]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(5) payments necessary to prevent the eviction of the Participant from the Participant's principal residence or foreclosure on the
mortgage on that residence; or
(6) expenses for the repair of damage to the Participant's principal residence that would qualify for the casualty deduction under
Code Â§165 (determined without regard to whether the loss exceeds 10% of adjusted gross income).
(b) Beneficiary-based distribution. If elected in Adoption Agreement, then effective as of the date specified in the Adoption
Agreement, a Participant's hardship event includes an immediate and heavy financial need of the Participant's "primary Beneficiary
under the Plan," that would constitute a hardship event if it occurred with respect to the Participant's Spouse or dependent as defined
under Code Â§152 (such hardship events being limited to educational expenses, funeral expenses and certain medical expenses). For
purposes of this Section, a Participant's "primary Beneficiary under the Plan" is an individual who is named as a Beneficiary under the
Plan (by the Participant or pursuant to Section 6.2(d)) and has an unconditional right to all or a portion of the Participant's Account
balance under the Plan upon the Participant's death.
(c) Other limits and conditions. No distribution shall be made pursuant to this Section unless the Administrator, based upon the
Participant's representation and such other facts as are known to the Administrator, determines that all of the following conditions are
satisfied:
(1) The distribution is not in excess of the amount of the immediate and heavy financial need of the Participant (including any
amounts necessary to pay any federal, state, or local taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution);
(2) The Participant has obtained all distributions, other than hardship distributions, and all nontaxable loans currently available
under all plans maintained by the Employer (to the extent the loan would not increase the hardship); and
(3) The Plan, and all other plans maintained by the Employer, provide that the Participant's Elective Deferrals and
nondeductible voluntary Employee contributions will be suspended for at least six (6) months after receipt of the hardship
distribution.
(d) Limitation on Account withdrawals. Notwithstanding the above, distributions from the Participant's Elective Deferral Account,
Qualified Matching Contribution Account and Qualified Nonelective Contribution Account pursuant to this Section shall be limited
solely to the Participant's Elective Deferrals and any income attributable thereto credited to the Participant's Elective Deferral Account
as of December 31, 1988.
(e) Other limits and conditions. Hardship distributions shall be made from an Account only to the extent that such Account has
become Vested at the time of such distribution. If elected in the Adoption Agreement, no distribution shall be made pursuant to this
Section from the Participant's Account until such Account has become fully Vested. Furthermore, if a hardship distribution is
permitted from more than one Account, the Administrator may determine any ordering of a Participant's hardship distribution from
such Accounts.
(f) Distribution rules apply. Any distribution made pursuant to this Section shall be made in a manner which is consistent with and
satisfies the provisions of Section 6.5, including, but not limited to, all notice and consent requirements of Code Â§Â§411(a)(11) and 417
and the Regulations thereunder.
12.11 IN-PLAN ROTH ROLLOVER CONTRIBUTIONS/TRANSFERS
(a) Right to elect In-Plan Roth Rollover Contribution/Transfer. If elected in the Adoption Agreement, then effective as of the
date specified in the Adoption Agreement, a Participant may elect an "In-Plan Roth Rollover Contribution" (hereinafter referred to as
an IRR) and/or an "In-Plan Roth Transfer" (hereinafter referred to as an IRT) in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, this
Section and the elections made in the Adoption Agreement. IRRs and IRTs will be subject to the Plan rules related to designated Roth
accounts. Participants shall be fully Vested in the portion of their Accounts attributable to IRRs and IRTs.
(b) Parties eligible to elect. The Employer in its Adoption Agreement can limit to Employees the right to elect to make IRRs or
IRTs. If the Employer does not make this election, then for purposes of eligibility for an IRR, the Plan will treat a Participant's
surviving spouse Beneficiary or alternate payee spouse or alternate payee former spouse as a Participant. A non-spouse Beneficiary
may not make an In-Plan Roth Rollover.
(c) Partially Vested accounts. IRRs and IRTs are permitted only from Vested amounts allocated to a qualifying source but may be
made from partially Vested Accounts unless the Employer elects otherwise in its Adoption Agreement. If a distribution is made to a
Participant who has not incurred a Severance from Employment and who is not fully Vested in the Participant's Account from which
the In-Plan Roth Rollover Contribution is to be made, and the Participant may increase the Vested percentage in such Account, then at
any relevant time Section 6.5(h) will apply to determine the Participant's Vested portion of the Account.

[PAGE 92]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(d) Amount limitation. The Employer in its Adoption Agreement may specify a minimum amount which will be accepted as an IRR
or IRT.
(e) Policy. The Administrator may adopt a policy setting for reasonable, nondiscriminatory procedures and administrative rules
relating to In-Plan Roth Rollover Contributions. Such a policy can prescribe administrative forms and limit the maximum number of
such rollovers a Participant may make during a Plan Year.
(f) Form and source of IRRs and IRTs.
(1) Direct Rollover. An IRR and an IRT may be made only by a direct rollover.
(2) Account source. A Participant may make an IRR or IRT from any account (other than a Designated Roth Account) unless
the Employer otherwise elects in its Adoption Agreement.
(3) Cash or in-kind. The Administrator may permit an IRR or IRT either by converting to cash any non-cash investments prior
to rolling over the Participant's distribution election amount to the In-Plan Roth Rollover Account or In-Plan Roth Transfer
Account, or by rolling over the Participant's current investments to the respective Accounts. A Plan loan so transferred (if such
transfer is permitted) without changing the repayment schedule is not treated as a new loan.
(4) No rollover or distribution treatment. Notwithstanding any other Plan provision, an IRR or an IRT is not a rollover
contribution for purposes of the Plan. Accordingly, the Plan will take into account the amounts attributable to an "in-Plan Roth
rollover contribution" in determining whether a Participant's Vested Account balance exceeds $5,000 for purposes of Code
Â§411(a)(11). In addition, an "in-Plan Roth rollover contribution" is not a distribution for purposes of Code Â§Â§401(a)(11) (relating
to spousal consent) and 3405(c) (relating to mandatory income tax withholding). Furthermore, it is not a distribution for purposes
of applying any limitations that a Plan may impose with respect to the number of in-service distributions permitted by the Plan.
(5) Eligibility and amount of IRR. A Participant must be eligible for a distribution in order to roll over a distribution to an
In-Plan Roth Rollover Contribution Account in accordance with this Section. A Participant may not make an IRR with regard to
an amount which is not an "eligible rollover distribution" as defined in Section 6.15. If specified in the Adoption Agreement, a
Participant may take an in-service distribution only for purposes of electing an IRR to an In-Plan Roth Rollover Contribution
Account. If elected in the Adoption Agreement, a portion of the amount that is eligible to be rolled over to an In-Plan Roth
Rollover Contribution Account may be distributed solely for the purpose of federal or state income tax withholding for the
Participant's anticipated tax obligations regarding the amount includible in the Participant's gross income by reason of the In-Plan
Roth Rollover Contribution (and the amount withheld for income taxes). The Administrator may limit the amount of the 100%
withholding distribution to the amount the Administrator reasonably determines is sufficient to satisfy the Participant's federal
and/or state income tax liability relating to the Plan distribution.
(g) Withdrawal of IRRs and IRTs. A Participant may withdraw amounts from the Participant's In-Plan Roth Rollover Contribution
Account or In-Plan Roth Transfer Account only when the Participant is eligible for a distribution from the Plan account that is the
source of the IRR or IRT. This Section does not expand (except, if elected, for distributions for withholding) or eliminate any
distribution rights on amounts that a Participant elects to treat as an IRR or IRT.
(h) Definitions.
(1) In-Plan Roth Rollover Contribution ("IRR"). An "in-Plan Roth rollover contribution" (IRR) means a rollover contribution
to the Plan that consists of a distribution from a Participant's Plan account, other than a designated Roth account, that the
Participant rolls over to the Participant's designated In-Plan Roth Rollover Contribution Account in the Plan, in accordance with
Code Â§402(c)(4).
(2) In-Plan Roth Rollover Transfer ("IRT"). An "in-Plan Roth rollover transfer" (IRT) means a rollover contribution to the
Plan that consists of a distribution from a Participant's Plan account, other than a designated Roth account, that the Participant
rolls over to the Participant's designated In-Plan Roth Transfer Account in the Plan, in accordance with Code Â§402(c)(4).
12.12 INSTRUCTIONS TO ADMINISTRATOR AND NOTIFICATION TO PARTICIPANTS
For Plan Years beginning after the end of the Plan Year in which this document is first adopted, if a âFlexible Discretionary
Matchâ contribution formula applies (i.e., a formula that provides an Employer with discretion regarding how to allocate a matching
contribution to Participants) and the Employer makes a âFlexible Discretionary Matchâ to the Plan, the Employer must provide the
Plan Administrator or Trustee written instructions describing (1) how the âFlexible Discretionary Matchâ formula will be allocated to
Participants (e.g., a uniform percentage of Elective Deferrals or a flat dollar amount), (2) the computation period(s) to which the
âFlexible Discretionary Matchâ formula applies, and (3) if applicable, a description of each business location or business classification
subject to separate âFlexible Discretionary Matchâ allocation formulas. Such instructions must be provided no later than the date on
which the âFlexible Discretionary Matchâ is made to the Plan. A summary of these instructions must be communicated to Participants
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers
87

[PAGE 93]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
who receive an allocation of the âFlexible Discretionary Matchâ no later than 60 days following the date on which the last
âdiscretionary matching contributionâ is made to the Plan for the Plan Year.
Solely for purposes of this Section, a matching contribution is to be considered as being a âFlexible Discretionary Matchâ
contribution unless the Employer has provided a definitely determinable allocation formula for the matching contribution on the
Adoption Agreement. In order to be definitely determinable, then the components of the allocation formula described in the preceding
sentence must be specified on the Adoption Agreement and cannot themselves be discretionary. Thus, regardless of whether the
contribution formula for the matching contribution is fixed or discretionary, the provisions of the preceding paragraph apply unless the
amount to be allocated to the Participant for the Plan Year can be determined without any discretion on the part of the Employer.
ARTICLE XIII
SIMPLE 401(K) PROVISIONS
13.1 SIMPLE 401(k) PROVISIONS
(a) If elected in the Adoption Agreement, this Plan is intended to be a SIMPLE 401(k) plan which satisfies the requirements of Code
Â§Â§401(k)(11) and 401(m)(10).
(b) The provisions of this Article apply for a "year" only if the following conditions are met:
(1) The Employer adopting this Plan is an "eligible employer." An "eligible employer" means, with respect to any "year," an
Employer that had no more than 100 Employees who received at least $5,000 of "compensation" from the Employer for the
preceding "year." In applying the preceding sentence, all employees of an Affiliated Employer and Leased Employees are taken
into account.
An "eligible employer" that has elected to use the SIMPLE 401(k) provisions but fails to be an "eligible employer" for any
subsequent "year," is treated as an "eligible employer" for the two (2) "years" following the last "year" the Employer was an
"eligible employer." If the failure is due to any acquisition, disposition, or similar transaction involving an "eligible employer,"
the preceding sentence applies only if the provisions of Code Â§410(b)(6)(C)(i) are satisfied.
(2) No contributions are made, or benefits accrued for services during the "year," on behalf of any "eligible employee" under
any other plan, contract, pension, or trust described in Code Â§219(g)(5)(A) or (B), maintained by the Employer.
(c) To the extent that any other provision of the Plan is inconsistent with the provisions of this Article, the provisions of this Article
govern.
13.2 DEFINITIONS
(a) "Compensation" means, for purposes of this Article, the sum of the wages, tips, and other compensation from the Employer
subject to federal income tax withholding (as described in Code Â§6051(a)(3)) and the Employee's salary deferral contributions made
under this or any other 401(k) plan, and, if applicable, elective deferrals under a Code Â§408(p) SIMPLE plan, a SARSEP, or a Code
Â§403(b) annuity contract and compensation deferred under a Code Â§457 plan, required to be reported by the Employer on Form W-2
(as described in Code Â§6051(a)(8)). For Self-Employed Individuals, "compensation" means net earnings from self-employment
determined under Code Â§1402(a) prior to subtracting any contributions made under this Plan on behalf of the individual.
"Compensation" also includes amounts paid for domestic service (as described in Code Â§3401(a)(3)). The provisions of the Plan
implementing the limit on Compensation under Code Â§401(a)(17) apply to the "compensation" under this Article.
(b) "Eligible employee" means, for purposes of this Article, any Participant who is entitled to make Elective Deferrals described in
Code Â§402(g) under the terms of the Plan.
(c) "Year" means the calendar year.
13.3 CONTRIBUTIONS
(a) Salary deferral contributions
(1) Each "eligible employee" may make a salary deferral election to have "compensation" reduced for the "year" in any amount
selected by the Employee subject to the limitation in Subsection (c) below. The Employer will make a salary deferral contribution
to the Plan, as an Elective Deferral, in the amount by which the Employee's "compensation" has been reduced.
(2) The total salary deferral contribution for the "year" for any Employee cannot exceed the limitation on salary deferral
contributions in effect for the "year" pursuant to Code Â§408(p)(2). The limit will be adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for
cost-of living increases under Code Â§408(p)(2)(E). Any such adjustments will be in multiples of $500. The amount of an

[PAGE 94]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
Employee's salary deferral contributions permitted for a "year" is increased for Employees aged 50 or over by the end of the
"year" by the amount of allowable Catch-Up Contributions pursuant to Code Â§414(v)(2). The limit will be adjusted by the
Secretary of the Treasury for cost-of-living increases under Code Â§414(v)(2)(C). Any such adjustments will be in multiples of
$500. Catch-Up Contributions are otherwise treated the same as other salary deferral contributions.
(b) Other contributions
(1) Matching contributions. Unless (2) below is elected, each "year" the Employer will make a matching contribution to the
Plan on behalf of each Employee who makes a salary deferral election under Section 13.3(a). The amount of the matching
contribution will be equal to the Employee's salary deferral contribution up to a limit of three percent (3%) of the Employee's
"compensation" for the full "year."
(2) Nonelective Contributions. For any "year," instead of a matching contribution, the Employer may elect to contribute a
Nonelective Contribution of two percent (2%) of "compensation" for the full "year" for each "eligible employee" who received at
least $5,000 of "compensation" from the Employer for the "year."
(c) Limitation on Other Contributions
No Employer or Employee contributions may be made to this Plan for the "year" other than salary deferral contributions
described in Section 13.3(a), matching or Nonelective Contributions described in Section 13.3(b) and rollover contributions described
in Regulation Â§1.402(c)-2, Q&A-1(a). Furthermore, the provisions of Section 4.4 which implement the limitations of Code Â§415 apply
to contributions made pursuant to this Section (other than Catch-Up Contributions).
13.4 ELECTION AND NOTICE REQUIREMENTS
(a) Election period
(1) In addition to any other election periods provided under the Plan, each "eligible employee" may make or modify a salary
deferral election during the 60-day period immediately preceding each January 1st.
(2) For the "year" an Employee becomes eligible to make salary deferral contributions under this Article, the 60-day election
period requirement of Subsection (a)(1) is deemed satisfied if the Employee may make or modify a salary deferral election during
a 60-day period that includes either the date the Employee becomes eligible or the day before.
(3) Each "eligible employee" may terminate a salary deferral election at any time during the "year."
(b) Notice requirements
(1) The Employer will notify each "eligible employee" prior to the 60-day election period described in Section 13.4(a) that a
salary deferral election or a modification to a prior election may be made during that period.
(2) The notification described in (1) above will indicate whether the Employer will provide a matching contribution described in
Section 13.3(b)(1) or a two percent (2%) Nonelective Contribution described in Section 13.3(b)(2) for that "year."
13.5 VESTING REQUIREMENTS
All benefits attributable to contributions made pursuant to this Article are nonforfeitable at all times, and all previous contributions
made under the Plan are nonforfeitable as of the beginning of the Plan Year that the 401(k) SIMPLE provisions apply.
13.6 TOP-HEAVY RULES
The Plan is not treated as a top-heavy plan under Code Â§416 for any "year" for which the provisions of this Article are effective and
satisfied.
13.7 NONDISCRIMINATION TESTS
The Plan is treated as meeting the requirements of Code Â§Â§401(k)(3)(A)(ii) and 401(m)(2) for any "year" for which the provisions of
this Article are effective and satisfied. Accordingly, Sections 12.4, 12.5, 12.6 and 12.7 shall not apply to the Plan for any "year" for which
this Article applies.
ARTICLE XIV
MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PROVISIONS
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers
89

[PAGE 95]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
14.1 ELECTION AND OVERRIDING EFFECT
If a Participating Employer that is not an Affiliated Employer adopts this Plan, then the provisions of this Article XIV shall apply to
such Participating Employer as of the Effective Date specified in its participation agreement and supersede any contrary provisions in the
basic Plan document or the Adoption Agreement. If this Article XIV applies, then the Plan shall be a multiple employer plan as described
in Code Â§413(c). In this case, the Employer and each Participating Employer acknowledge that the Plan is a multiple employer plan subject
to the rules of Code Â§413(c) and the Regulations thereunder, and specific annual reporting requirements. For purposes of this Article,
Participating Employers that are Affiliated Employers are treated as a single Participating Employer.
14.2 DEFINITIONS
The following definitions shall apply to this Article XIV and shall supersede any conflicting definitions in the Plan:
(a) Employee. "Employee" means any common law employee, Self-Employed Individual, Leased Employee or other person the
Code treats as an employee of a Participating Employer for purposes of the Participating Employer's qualified plan. Either the
Adoption Agreement or a participation agreement to the Adoption Agreement may designate any Employee, or class of Employees, as
not eligible to participate in the Plan.
(b) Lead Employer. "Lead Employer" means the signatory Employer to the Adoption Agreement execution page, and does not
include any Affiliated Employer or Participating Employer. The "lead Employer" has the same meaning as the Employer for purposes
of making Plan amendments and other purposes regardless of whether the "lead Employer" is also a Participating Employer under this
Article XIV. The âlead Employerâ may execute a Participation Agreement setting forth elections which are specific to the âlead
Employerâ.
14.3 PARTICIPATING EMPLOYER ELECTIONS
The participation agreement must identify the Participating Employer and the covered Employees and provide for the Participating
Employer's signature. In addition, in the participation agreement, the "lead Employer" shall specify which elections, if any, the
Participating Employer can modify, and any restrictions on the modifications. Any such modification shall apply only to the employees of
that Participating Employer. The Participating Employer shall make any such modification by selecting the appropriate option on its
participation agreement to the "lead Employer's" Adoption Agreement. To the extent that the Adoption Agreement does not permit
modification of an election, any attempt by a Participating Employer to modify the election shall have no effect on the Plan and the
Participating Employer is bound by the Plan terms as selected by the "lead Employer." If a Participating Employer does not make any
permissible participation agreement election modifications, then with regard to any election, the Participating Employer is bound by the
Adoption Agreement terms as completed by the "lead Employer." Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section, if a standardized
Adoption Agreement is being used, then the elections available to Participating Employers must be limited to the elections available to the
"lead Employer" that ensure the Plan, by design, satisfies the minimum coverage requirements of Code Â§410(b) and the nondiscrimination
requirements of Code Â§401(a)(4).
14.4 HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEE STATUS
Status as a Highly Compensated Employee shall be determined separately with respect to each Participating Employer which is not an
Affiliated Employer.
14.5 TESTING
(a) Separate status. The Administrator shall perform the tests listed below separately for each Participating Employer, with respect
to the Employees of that Participating Employer. For this purpose, the Employees of a Participating Employer, and their allocations
and accounts, shall be treated as though they were in separate plan. Any correction action, such as additional contributions or
corrective distributions, shall only affect the Employees of the Participating Employer. The tests subject to this separate treatment are:
(1) The ADP test in Section 12.4.
(2) The ACP test in Section 12.6.
(3) Nondiscrimination testing as described in Code Â§401(a)(4) and the applicable Regulations.
(4) Coverage testing as described in Code Â§410(b) and the applicable Regulations.
(b) Joint status. The Administrator shall perform the following tests for the Plan as whole, without regard to employment by a
particular Participating Employer:
(1) Applying the Code Â§415 limitation in Section 4.4.
Â© 2020 Ascensus, LLC or its suppliers

[PAGE 96]
Defined Contribution Pre-Approved Plan
(2) Applying the Code Â§402(g) limitation in Section 12.2.
(3) Applying the limit on Catch-Up Contributions in Section 12.2.
14.6 TOP HEAVY PROVISIONS
The Plan will apply the provisions of Article IX separately to each Participating Employer. The Plan will be considered separate plans
for each Participating Employer and its Employees for purposes of determining whether such a separate plan is top-heavy under Section 9.1
or is entitled to the exemption described in Section 12.8(f) or 12.9(i). For purposes of applying this Article to a Participating Employer, the
Participating Employer and any business which is related to that Participating Employer shall be the "Employer" for purposes of Section
9.1, and the terms "Key Employee" and "Non-Key Employee" shall refer only to the Employees of that Participating Employer. If such a
Participating Employer's separate plan is top-heavy, then:
(a) Highest contribution rate. The Administrator shall determine the highest Key Employee contribution rate under Section 4.3(g)
by reference to the Key Employees and their allocations in the separate plan of that Participating Employer;
(b) Top-heavy minimum allocation. The Administrator shall determine the amount of any required top-heavy minimum allocation
separately for that separate plan under Section 4.3(f); and
(c) Plan Which Will Satisfy. The Participating Employer shall make any additional contributions Section 4.3(k) requires.
14.7 COMPENSATION
(a) Separate determination. For the following purposes, a Participant's Compensation shall be determined separately for each
Participating Employer:
(1) Nondiscrimination and coverage. All of the separate tests listed in Section 14.5(a).
(2) Top-heavy. Application of the top-heavy rules in Article IX.
(3) Allocations. Application of allocations under Article IV.
(4) HCE determination. The determination of an Employee's status as a Highly Compensated Employee.
(b) Joint status. For all Plan purposes other than those described in Section 14.7(a), including but not limited to determining the
Code Â§415 limits in Section 4.4, Compensation includes all Compensation paid by or for any Participating Employer.
14.8 SERVICE
An Employee's service includes all Hours of Service and Years of Service with any and all Participating Employers. An Employee
who terminates employment with one Participating Employer and immediately commences employment with another Participating
Employer has not separated from service or had a severance from employment.
14.9 REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS
If a Participant is a more than 5% Owner (under Code Â§416(i) and Section 6.8(e)(6)) of any Participating Employer for which the
Participant is an Employee in the Plan Year the Participant attains age 70 1/2, then the Participant's "required beginning date" under
Section 6.8(e)(5) shall be the April 1 following the close of the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 70 1/2.
14.10 COOPERATION AND INDEMNIFICATION
(a) Cooperation. Each Participating Employer agrees to timely provide all information the Administrator deems necessary to insure
the Plan is operated in accordance with the requirements of the Code and the Act and will cooperate fully with the "lead Employer,"
the Plan, the Plan fiduciaries and other proper representatives in maintaining the qualified status of the Plan. Such cooperation will
include payment of such amounts into the Plan, to be allocated to employees of the Participating Employer, which are reasonably
required to maintain the tax-qualified status of the Plan.
(b) Indemnity. Each Participating Employer will indemnify and hold harmless the Administrator, the "lead Employer" and its
subsidiaries; officers, directors, shareholders, employees, and agents of the "lead Employer"; the Plan; the Trustees, Fiduciaries,
Participants and Beneficiaries of the Plan, as well as their respective successors and assigns, against any cause of action, loss, liability,
damage, cost, or expense of any nature whatsoever (including, but not limited to, attorney's fees and costs, whether or not suit is
brought, as well as IRS plan disqualifications, other sanctions or compliance fees or DOL fiduciary breach sanctions and penalties)

information with regard to the Plan which causes the Plan to fail to satisfy the requirements of a tax-qualified plan. This indemnity
provision shall continue to apply to a Participating Employer with respect to the period such entity was a Participating Employer, even
if the Participating Employer withdraws or is removed pursuant to Sections 14.11 or 14.12.
14.11 INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION
Unless the "lead Employer" provides otherwise in an addendum hereto, the "lead Employer" shall have the power to terminate the
participation of any Participating Employer (hereafter "Terminated Employer") in this Plan. If and when the "lead Employer" wishes to
exercise this power, the following shall occur:
(a) Notice. The "lead Employer" shall give the "Terminated Employer" a notice of the "lead Employer's" intent to terminate the
"Terminated Employer's" status as a Participating Employer of the Plan. The "lead Employer" will provide such notice not less than
thirty (30) days prior to the date of termination unless the "lead Employer" determines that the interest of Plan Participants requires
earlier termination.
(b) Spin-off. The "lead Employer" shall establish a new defined contribution plan, using the provisions of this Plan with any
modifications contained in the "Terminated Employer's" participation agreement, as a guide to establish a new defined contribution
plan (the "spin-off plan"). The "lead Employer" will direct the Trustee to transfer (in accordance with the rules of Code Â§414(l) and
the provisions of Section 8.3) the Accounts of the Employees of the "Terminated Employer" to the "spin-off plan." The "Terminated
Employer" shall be the Employer, Administrator, and sponsor of the "spin-off plan." The Trustee of the "spin-off plan" shall be the
person or entity designated by the "Terminated Employer," or, in the absence of any such designation, the chief executive officer of
the "Terminated Employer." If state law prohibits the "Terminated Employer" from serving as Trustee, the Trustee is the president of a
corporate "Terminated Employer," the managing partner of a partnership "Terminated Employer," the managing member of a limited
liability company "Terminated Employer," the sole proprietor of a proprietorship "Terminated Employer," or in the case of any other
entity type, such other person with title and responsibilities similar to the foregoing. However, the "lead Employer" shall have the
option to designate an appropriate financial institution as Trustee instead if necessary to protect the interest of the Participants. The
"lead Employer" shall have the authority to charge the "Terminated Employer" or the Accounts of the Employees of the "Terminated
Employer" a reasonable fee to pay the expenses of establishing the "spin-off plan."
(c) Alternative. The "Terminated Employer," in lieu of creation of the "spin-off plan" under (b) above, has the option to elect a
transfer alternative in accordance with this Subsection (c).
(1) Election. To exercise the option described in this Subsection, the "Terminated Employer" must inform the "lead Employer"
of its choice and must supply any reasonably required documentation as soon as practical. If the "lead Employer" has not
received notice of a "Terminated Employer's" exercise of this option within ten (10) days prior to the stated date of termination,
the "lead Employer" can choose to disregard the exercise and proceed with the Spin-off.
(2) Transfer. If the "Terminated Employer" selects this option, the Administrator shall transfer (in accordance with the rules of
Code Â§414(l) and the provisions of Section 8.3) the Accounts of the Employees of the "Terminated Employer" to a qualified plan
the "Terminated Employer" maintains. To exercise this option, the "Terminated Employer" must deliver to the "lead Employer"
or Administrator in writing the name and other relevant information of the transferee plan and must provide such assurances that
the Administrator shall reasonably require to demonstrate that the transferee plan is a qualified plan.
(d) Participants. The Employees of the "Terminated Employer" shall cease to be eligible to accrue additional benefits under the Plan
with respect to Compensation paid by the "Terminated Employer," effective as of the date of termination. To the extent that these
Employees have accrued but unpaid contributions as of the date of termination, the "Terminated Employer" shall pay such amounts to
the Plan or the "spin-off plan" no later than thirty (30) days after the date of termination, unless the "Terminated Employer" effectively
selects the Transfer option under Subsection (c)(2) above.
(e) Consent. By its signature on the participation agreement, the Terminated Employer specifically consents to the provisions of this
Article and agrees to perform its responsibilities with regard to the "spin-off plan," if necessary.
14.12 VOLUNTARY TERMINATION
A Participating Employer (hereafter "withdrawing employer") may voluntarily withdraw from participation in this Plan at any time. If
and when a "withdrawing employer" wishes to withdraw, the following shall occur:
(a) Notice. The "withdrawing employer" shall inform the "lead Employer" and the Administrator of its intention to withdraw from
the Plan. The Withdrawing Employer must give the notice not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of its withdrawal.
(b) Procedure. The "withdrawing employer" and the "lead Employer" shall agree upon procedures for the orderly withdrawal of the
"withdrawing employer" from the plan. Such procedures may include any of the optional spin-off or transfer options described in
Section 14.11.

(c) Costs. The "withdrawing employer" shall bear all reasonable costs associated with withdrawal and transfer under this Section.
(d) Participants. The Employees of the "withdrawing employer" shall cease to be eligible to accrue additional benefits under the
Plan as to Compensation paid by the "withdrawing employer," effective as of the effective date of withdrawal. To the extent that such
Employees have accrued but unpaid contributions as of the effective date of withdrawal, the "withdrawing employer" shall contribute
such amounts to the Plan or the "spin-off plan" promptly after the effective date of withdrawal, unless the accounts are transferred to a
qualified plan the "withdrawing employer" maintains.
14.13 DESIGNATION OF AGENT
Each Participating Employer shall be deemed to be a part of this Plan; provided, however, that with respect to all its relations with the
Trustee (or Insurer) and Administrator for purposes of this Plan, each Participating Employer shall be deemed to have designated
irrevocably the Employer as its agent. Unless the context of the Plan clearly indicates otherwise, the word "Employer" shall be deemed to
include each Participating Employer as related to its adoption of the Plan.
