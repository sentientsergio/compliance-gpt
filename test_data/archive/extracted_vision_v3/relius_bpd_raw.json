The method must be used consistently for all Participants and for all corrective distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year. The Administrator will not calculate and distribute \"income\" for the period between the end of the Plan Year in which the Excess Contribution and prior to the date of the distribution (the \"gap period\").\n\n(i) Method of allocating \"income.\" The Administrator may use any reasonable method for computing the \"income\" allocable to Excess Contributions, provided that the method does not violate Code \u00a7401(a)(4), is used consistently for all Participants and for all corrective distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year, and is used by the Plan for allocating \"income\" to Participant's Accounts. A Plan will not fail to use a reasonable method for computing the \"income\" allocable to Excess Contributions merely because the \"income\" allocable to Excess Contributions is determined on a date that is no more than seven (7) days before the distribution.\n\n(ii) Alternative method of allocating Plan Year income. The Administrator may allocate \"income\" to Excess Contributions for the Plan Year by multiplying the \"income\" for the Plan Year allocable to the Elective Deferrals and other amounts taken into account under this Section (including contributions made for the Plan Year), by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Excess Contributions for the Employee for the Plan Year, and the denominator of which is the sum of the:\n\n(A) Account balance attributable to Elective Deferrals and other contributions taken into account under this Section as of the beginning of the Plan Year, and\n\n(B) Any additional amount of such contributions made for the Plan Year.\n\n(iii) Safe harbor method of allocating gap period income. The Administrator may use the safe harbor method in this paragraph to determine \"income\" on Excess Contributions for the \"gap period.\" Under this safe harbor method, \"income\" on Excess Contributions for the \"gap period\" is equal to ten percent (10%) of the \"income\" allocable to Excess Contributions for the Plan Year that would be determined under paragraph (ii) above, multiplied by the number of calendar months that have elapsed since the end of the Plan Year. For purposes of calculating the number of calendar months that have elapsed under the safe harbor method, a corrective distribution that is made on or before the fifteenth day of a month is treated as made on the last day of the preceding month and a distribution made after the fifteenth day of a month is treated as made on the last day of the month.\n\n(iv) Alternative method for allocating Plan Year and gap period income. The Administrator may determine the allocable gain or loss for the aggregate of the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" by applying the alternative method provided by paragraph (ii) above to this aggregate period. This is accomplished by substituting the \"income\" for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the \"income\" for the Plan Year and by substituting the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year and the \"gap period\" for the contributions taken into account under this Section for the Plan Year.",
