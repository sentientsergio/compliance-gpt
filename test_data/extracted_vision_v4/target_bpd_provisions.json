Each such person will be bound as may be required by law. The term Plan Administrator will include any person authorized to perform the duties of the Plan Administrator and properly identified to the Trustee or Custodian as such. Where the Adopting Employer dies, becomes incapacitated, or is otherwise unable to fulfill its duties, and neither the Adopting Employer nor the managing body of the Adopting Employer will or can appoint a successor Plan Administrator within a reasonable period of time thereafter, the Plan Administrator may appoint a successor Plan Administrator. Where the Plan Administrator will not or cannot appoint a successor Plan Administrator, the majority of Participants in the Plan will have the authority to appoint a successor Plan Administrator that will not be obligated to do so if engaging a majority of Participants would result in unreasonable time, expense, or administrative burden. The Pre-approved Document Provider will in no case be designated as the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator must ensure that the authority over the portion of the Fund subject to the trust requirements of ERISA section 403(a) is assigned to a Trustee (subject to the proper and lawful directions of the Plan Administrator), or an investment manager.",

A Participant who wishes to enroll as a Contributing Participant must deliver (either in writing or in any other form permitted by the IRS and the DOL) a salary reduction agreement or agreement to make Nondeferrable Employee Contributions) to the Plan Administrator except as set forth in Plan Section 3.01(E) below.

Contribution Rules.\n\ni. Maximum Permissible Amount \u2013 Except in the case of a rollover contribution (as permitted by Code sections 402(c), 402(e)(6), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 403(b)(10), 408(d)(3), and 457(b)(16)) or a contribution made in accordance with the terms of a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plan as described in Code section 408(k), no contributions will be accepted unless they are in cash, and the total of such contributions will not exceed the lesser of 100 percent of the Traditional IRA Owner\u2019s compensation, or $3,000 for any taxable year beginning in 2002 through 2004; $4,000 for any taxable year beginning in 2005 through 2007; and $5,000 for any taxable year beginning in 2008 and years thereafter.\n\nAfter 2008, the limit will be adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for cost-of-living increases under Code section 219(b)(5)(D). Such adjustments will be in multiples of $500.\n\nIf the Traditional IRA Owner makes regular contributions to both Traditional and Roth IRAs for a taxable year, the maximum regular contribution that can be made to all the Traditional IRA Owner\u2019s Traditional IRAs for that taxable year is reduced by the regular contributions made to the Traditional IRA Owner\u2019s Roth IRAs for the taxable year.\n\nii. Catch-up Contributions \u2013 In the case of a Traditional IRA Owner who is age 50 or older by the close of the taxable year, the annual cash contribution limit is increased by $500 for any taxable year beginning 2002 through 2005, and by $1,000 for any taxable year beginning in 2006 and years thereafter.\n\niii. SIMPLE IRA \u2013 No contributions will be accepted under a SIMPLE IRA plan established by any employer pursuant to Code section 408(p). Also, no transfer or rollover of funds attributable to contributions made by a particular employer under its SIMPLE IRA plan will be accepted from a SIMPLE IRA, that is, an IRA used in conjunction with a SIMPLE IRA plan, before the expiration of the two-year period beginning on the date the employee first participated in that employer\u2019s SIMPLE IRA plan.\n\nb. Traditional IRA Owner Distributions.\n\ni. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the distribution of the Traditional IRA Owner\u2019s interest in this Traditional IRA will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code sections 408(a)(6) and 408A and the corresponding regulations, the provisions of which are herein incorporated by reference. If distributions are made from an annuity contract purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder must satisfy the requirements of Q&A 4 of Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-6, rather than Plan Section 3.15(B)(2)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) and (B)(2)(c). The required minimum distributions calculated for this Traditional IRA may be withdrawn from another Traditional IRA of the Traditional IRA Owner in accordance with Q&A 9 of Treasury Regulation section 1.408-8.\n\nii. The entire value of the account of the Traditional IRA Owner for whose benefit the account is maintained will begin to be distributed no later than the first day of April following the calendar year in which such Traditional IRA Owner attains age 70\u00bd (the required beginning date) over the life of such Traditional IRA Owner and their designated beneficiary.\n\niii. The amount to be distributed each year, beginning with the calendar year in which the Traditional IRA Owner attains age 70\u00bd and continuing through the year of death, will not be less than the quotient obtained by dividing the value of the Traditional IRA (as modified by Plan Section 3.15(B)(2)(c)(iii) as of the end of the preceding year by the distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table in Q&A 2 of Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-9, using the Traditional IRA Owner\u2019s age as of their birthday in the year. However, if the Traditional IRA Owner\u2019s sole designated beneficiary is their surviving Spouse and such Spouse is more than 10 years younger than the Traditional IRA Owner, then the distribution period is determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table in Q&A 3 of Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-9, using the ages as of the Traditional IRA Owner\u2019s and Spouse\u2019s birthdays in that year.\n\niv. The required minimum distribution for the year the Traditional IRA Owner attains age 70\u00bd can be made as late as April 1 of the following year. The required minimum distribution for any other year must be made by the end of such year.\n\nc. Beneficiary Rights \u2013 If the Traditional IRA Owner dies before their entire interest is distributed to them, the entire remaining interest will be distributed as follows.\n\ni. Death on or After Required Beginning Date \u2013 If the designated beneficiary is someone other than the Traditional IRA Owner\u2019s surviving Spouse, the remaining interest will be distributed over the remaining life expectancy of the designated beneficiary, with such life expectancy determined using the beneficiary\u2019s age as of their birthday in the year following the year of the Traditional IRA Owner\u2019s death, or over the period described in Plan Section 3.15(B)(2)(c)(i) if longer.\n",

Separate Fund \u2013 First, the portion of the Individual Account invested in each Investment Fund as of the previous Valuation Date is determined. Each such portion is reduced by any withdrawal made from the applicable Investment Fund to or for the benefit of a Participant or the Participant\u2019s Beneficiary, further reduced by any amounts forfeited by the Participant pursuant to Plan Section 4.01(C) or (D), and further reduced by any transfer to another Investment Fund since the previous Valuation Date, and is increased by any amount transferred from another Investment Fund since the previous Valuation Date. The resulting amounts are net the net Individual Account portions invested in the Investment Funds.\n\nb. No Separate Fund \u2013 Second, the net Individual Account portions invested in each Investment Fund are adjusted upwards or downwards, pro rata (i.e., using the ratio of each net Individual Account portion to the sum of all net Individual Account portions) so that the sum of all the net Individual Account portions invested in an Investment Fund will equal the then fair market value of the Investment Fund. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, for the first Plan Year only, the net Individual Account portions will be the sum of all contributions made to each Participant\u2019s Individual Account during the first Plan Year.\n\nc. Allocations \u2013 Third, any contributions to the Plan and Forfeitures are allocated in accordance with the appropriate allocation provisions of Plan Section Three. For purposes of this Plan Section Seven, contributions made by the Employer for any Plan Year but after that Plan Year will be considered to have been made on the last day of that Plan Year regardless of when paid to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable).",

Limits on Distribution Periods \u2014 As of the first Distribution Calendar Year, distributions to a Participant, if not made in a single sum, may only be made over one of the following periods (or a combination thereof):\na. the life of the Participant,\nb. the joint lives of the Participant and a Designated Beneficiary,\nc. a period certain not extending beyond the Life Expectancy of the Participant, or\nd. a period certain not extending beyond the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the Participant and a Designated Beneficiary.\n\nB. Time and Manner of Distribution\n1. Required Beginning Date \u2014 The Participant's entire interest, less any amount held in a Qualifying Longevity Annuity Contract, will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the Participant no later than the Participant's Required Beginning Date.\n\nFor purposes of this Plan Section 5.05(B) and Plan Section 5.05(D), unless Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(iii) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the Participant's Required Beginning Date.
