SYSTEM ROLE:
You extract provisions from a single BPD page and return JSON ONLY. No code fences, no prose.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:

INPUTS
- PDF_PAGE: {{PDF_PAGE}}   (integer)
- IMAGE: (the page image)

TASK
From this page, extract only substantive provisions (actual legal content). Skip headings, TOC lines, headers/footers, section dividers, and pages that say only "(continued on next page)".

OUTPUT
Return a JSON array. Each item must have exactly these keys:

{
  "pdf_page": {{PDF_PAGE}},
  "section_number": "string",
  "section_title": "string",
  "provision_text": "string",
  "provision_type": "definition|operational|regulatory|unknown",
  "parent_section": "string or null"
}

RULES
- JSON array only. No preface or trailing text.
- Extract BOTH parent provisions AND their children as separate items.
  • Example: If section 1.01 has subsections 1.01(a) and 1.01(b), extract all three:
    - 1.01 (parent_section: null)
    - 1.01(a) (parent_section: "1.01")
    - 1.01(b) (parent_section: "1.01")
  • If 1.01(b) has subsections 1.01(b)(1), 1.01(b)(2), extract:
    - 1.01(b) (parent_section: "1.01")
    - 1.01(b)(1) (parent_section: "1.01(b)")
    - 1.01(b)(2) (parent_section: "1.01(b)")
- A heading with no following sentences is NOT a provision.
- If nothing substantive appears on this page, return [].
- Don't summarize or paraphrase. Copy text verbatim (normalized whitespace is OK).
- If a table conveys a rule, include it as plain text with line breaks.
- Heuristics:
  • Definitions often use "means".
  • Operational language often uses SHALL/MUST/MAY/WILL or prescribes schedules/procedures.
  • Regulatory provisions cite Code/Reg sections (e.g., IRC §401(a)(9)).
  Choose the single best provision_type; if uncertain, use "unknown".

EXAMPLES

Example 1 - Page with hierarchical definitions:
[
  {
    "pdf_page": 6,
    "section_number": "1.01",
    "section_title": "Account",
    "provision_text": "'Account' means any separate notational account established and maintained by the Administrator for each Participant under the Plan.",
    "provision_type": "definition",
    "parent_section": null
  },
  {
    "pdf_page": 6,
    "section_number": "1.01(a)",
    "section_title": "Combined Account",
    "provision_text": "'Combined Account' means the account representing the Participant's total interest under the Plan...",
    "provision_type": "definition",
    "parent_section": "1.01"
  },
  {
    "pdf_page": 6,
    "section_number": "1.01(b)",
    "section_title": "Elective Deferral Account",
    "provision_text": "'Elective Deferral Account' means the account established hereunder to which Elective Deferrals are allocated...",
    "provision_type": "definition",
    "parent_section": "1.01"
  }
]

Example 2 - Page with headings only:
[]
