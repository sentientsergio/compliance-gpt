Extract election questions and options from this Adoption Agreement page as JSON array ONLY.

CRITICAL: Distinguish between blank templates and completed elections.

For each election option's "value" field:
- Use null if the checkbox is UNCHECKED (☐ or empty box)
- Use "checked" ONLY if checkbox is CHECKED (☑, ✓, ✗, filled box, or marked)
- Use null if fill-in field is BLANK (___, blank line, or empty space)
- Use "text" ONLY if fill-in field contains ACTUAL TEXT or numbers

Common blank template indicators:
- Checkboxes: ☐ (empty), [ ] (unchecked)
- Fill-ins: ____, _____ (blank underscores), empty lines
- Sample documents: May have "SAMPLE" watermark - treat all as blank

Common completed election indicators:
- Checkboxes: ☑ (checked), ✓ (checkmark), ✗ (X mark), filled/shaded box
- Fill-ins: Handwritten or typed text, numbers, dates in the blank space

Output format (JSON array only, no explanatory text):

  "question_number": "1",
  "question_text": "Entry date for new employees (select one):",
  "election_type": "radio",
  "section_context": "Section 2: Eligibility",

Remember: Most Adoption Agreements you see will be BLANK TEMPLATES with no elections made. Only mark "checked" or "text" if you see clear evidence of a selection or filled value.

NO explanatory text. JSON array only.
