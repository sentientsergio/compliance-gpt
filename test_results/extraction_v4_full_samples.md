### SAMPLE 4 (Item #106 of 542)
**Section:** (blank)
**Title:** Compensation Dollar limitation

**ASSESSMENT:** ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL / ⚠️ CONCERN

**FULL TEXT:**
```
Compensation Dollar limitation. For any Plan Year (or other applicable determination period) Compensation in excess of $200,000 shall be disregarded for all purposes other than for purposes of Elective Deferrals, except that the Administrator may impose the limit for purposes of a Plan imposed limit on Elective Deferrals. The dollar amount shall be adjusted by the Commissioner for increases in the cost-of-living in accordance with Code §401(a)(17)(B) and is $275,000 for 2018. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any "determination period" beginning with or within such calendar year. If a "determination period" consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the $275,000 annual Compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the "determination period," and the denominator of which is twelve (12). In applying any Plan limitation on the amount of matching contributions or any Plan limit on Elective Deferrals which are subject to matching contributions, where such limits are expressed as a percentage of Compensation, the Administrator may apply the Compensation limit under this Section annually, even if the matching contribution formula is applied on any time interval which is less than the full Plan Year or the Administrator may pro rate the Compensation limit.
```

**YOUR NOTES:**
**SERGIO'S CONCERN:** "Section number in the text - is it because it labels the term?"
**CLAUDE'S RESPONSE:** Yes - "Compensation Dollar limitation" is the provision title/label. The text starts with repeating the title (common in legal docs). This is substantive content defining the IRC §401(a)(17) compensation limit rules.

```

### SAMPLE 7 (Item #230 of 542)
**Section:** (blank)
**Title:** (h) Elective Transfers

**ASSESSMENT:** ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL / ⚠️ CONCERN

**FULL TEXT:**
```
(h) Elective Transfers. The Administrator may authorize the Trustee to (in accordance with the proper election of a Participant or Beneficiary), to enter into an agreement with the trustee of any other trust fund to transfer as an "Elective Transfer" to the other plan or to receive as an "Elective Transfer" into this Plan, all or a portion of the Account of the electing Participant or Beneficiary. The specific requirements for an "Elective Transfer" depend upon the type of "Elective Transfer" that is utilized to effect the transfer, as described herein.

(1) Definition of "Elective Transfer." An "Elective Transfer" is a transfer made at the election of a Participant (or, as applicable, a Beneficiary) and which satisfies the requirements of this Subsection (h).

(2) Code §411(d)(6)(D) transfer. A Code §411(d)(6)(D) Transfer means a transfer under Code §411(d)(6)(D) between defined contribution plans, and which a Participant or Beneficiary elects following required vesting notice. Under this Subsection (h)(2), the Account need not be distributable at the time of transfer and Code §411(d)(6) protected benefits specifically relating to distribution methods do not carry over to the transferee plan, except, if applicable, the qualified joint and survivor annuity rules set forth in Sections 6.5 and 6.6.

(3) Acquisition or employment change transfer. An acquisition or employment change transfer means a transfer under Regulation §1.411(d)-4 Q/A-3(b), between such defined contribution plans as described therein, and which a Participant elects. Under this Subsection (h)(3), the Account need not be distributable at the time of transfer and Code §411(d)(6) protected benefits do not carry over to the transferee plan, except, if applicable, the qualified joint and survivor annuity rules set forth in Sections 6.5 and 6.6.

(4) Distributable event transfer. A distributable event transfer means a transfer under Regulation §1.411(d)-4 Q/A-3(c), between Code §401(a) plans, and which a Participant elects. Under this Subsection (h)(4), the Account must be distributable at the time of transfer, but not entirely as a lump-sum which is an eligible rollover distribution. Code §411(d)(6) protected benefits do not carry over to the transferee plan.
```

**YOUR NOTES:**
**SERGIO'S CONCERN:** "Sample 7 includes '(a)'"
**CLAUDE'S RESPONSE:** The title is "(h) Elective Transfers" - the (h) is a subsection label from the parent section. The provision text includes numbered sub-paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4). This is substantive - it defines different types of elective transfers with specific IRC/Regulation requirements. NOT a heading.

```
Upon the complete discontinuance of the Employer's contributions to the Plan (if this is a profit sharing plan) or upon any full or partial termination of the Plan, all amounts then credited to the Account of any affected Participant shall become 100% Vested and shall not thereafter be subject to Forfeiture.
```

```

### SAMPLE 10 (Item #434 of 542)
**Section:** 12.4(h)
**Title:** Aggregation with other plans.

**ASSESSMENT:** ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL / ⚠️ CONCERN

**FULL TEXT:**
```
Aggregation with other plans. In the event this Plan satisfies the requirements of Code §401(a)(4), 401(k), or 410(b) only if aggregated with one or more other plans, or if one or more other plans satisfy the requirements of such sections of the Code only if aggregated with this Plan, then this Section shall be applied by determining the ADP of Employees as if all such plans were a single plan. If more than ten percent (10%) of the Employer's "NHCEs" are involved in a plan coverage change as defined in Regulation §1.401(k)-2(c)(4), then any adjustments to the "NHCEs" ADP for the prior year will be made in accordance with such Regulations, if the Employer has elected in the Adoption Agreement to use the prior year testing method. Plans may be aggregated in order to satisfy Code §401(k) only if they have the same Plan Year and use the same ADP testing method.
```
