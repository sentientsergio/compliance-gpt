# Red Team Sprint: BPD Crosswalk Validation

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Sprint Focus:** Validation of POC Parallel Crosswalk results
**Component:** BPD semantic mapping (source_bpd_01 → target_bpd_05)
**Reviewer:** Sergio DuBois
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

---

## Executive Summary

### Claims to Validate
- **Total mappings:** 425 source provisions
- **Semantic matches:** 82 (19.3%)
- **High confidence (≥90%):** 77 matches (93.9% of matches)
- **Medium confidence (70-89%):** 4 matches (4.9%)
- **Low confidence (<70%):** 1 match (1.2%)
- **High-impact variances:** 186
- **Medium-impact variances:** 136

### Test Scope
This Red Team Sprint validates the accuracy of:
1. Semantic matching (true vs false positives/negatives)
2. Confidence score calibration (90%+ scores should be 90%+ accurate)
3. Variance classification (Administrative/Design/Regulatory)
4. Impact level assessment (High/Medium/Low)
5. Edge case handling (embeddings vs LLM disagreement)

### Methodology
- **Random sampling:** 10 items per test category (reproducible with seed=42)
- **Manual verification:** Domain expert review of provision text and reasoning
- **Pass/fail criteria:** >90% accuracy for high-confidence claims, >70% for medium
- **Time investment:** 2-3 hours for thorough review

## Test 1: High-Confidence Matches (≥90%)

**Hypothesis:** These provisions are semantically equivalent
**Sample:** 10 random matches from 77 total high-confidence matches
**Method:** Manual side-by-side comparison of provision text

### Sample 1: Confidence 100%
- **Source:** [Section/Title from CSV]
- **Target:** [Section/Title from CSV]
- **Embedding:** 0.580, **LLM:** 1.00
- **Reasoning:** "Both provisions define 'life expectancy' as computed using the Single Life Table..."
- **✅ VALIDATED / ❌ FAILED / ⏸️ UNCERTAIN:** [TO BE COMPLETED]
- **Notes:** [Reviewer comments]

### Sample 2: Confidence 97%
- **Source:** [Section/Title from CSV]
- **Target:** [Section/Title from CSV]
- **Embedding:** 0.889, **LLM:** 0.97
- **Reasoning:** "Both provisions define 'Limitation Year' as a 12-consecutive month period..."
- **✅ VALIDATED / ❌ FAILED / ⏸️ UNCERTAIN:** [TO BE COMPLETED]
- **Notes:** [Reviewer comments]

_[Samples 3-10 follow same format]_

### Test 1 Results Summary
- **Validated (True Positives):** [X/10]
- **Failed (False Positives):** [X/10]
- **Uncertain (Needs Further Review):** [X/10]
- **Accuracy Rate:** [X%]
- **Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS (>90%) / ❌ FAIL (<90%)

---

## Test 2: No Matches

**Hypothesis:** These provisions have no semantic equivalent in target document
**Sample:** 10 random no-matches from 343 total unmatched provisions
**Method:** Manual verification that no target provision is equivalent

### Sample 1: Best Embedding Similarity 0.XX
- **Source:** [Section/Title from CSV]
- **Reasoning for NO match:** [From CSV]
- **✅ VALIDATED (Correct Rejection) / ❌ FAILED (Missed Match) / ⏸️ UNCERTAIN:** [TO BE COMPLETED]
- **Notes:** [Reviewer comments - did we miss a legitimate match?]

_[Samples 2-10 follow same format]_

### Test 2 Results Summary
- **Validated (True Negatives):** [X/10]
- **Failed (False Negatives - we missed a match):** [X/10]
- **Uncertain:** [X/10]
- **Accuracy Rate:** [X%]
- **Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS (>90%) / ❌ FAIL (<90%)

---

## Test 3: High-Impact Variances

**Hypothesis:** These variances affect participant rights, contributions, or qualification
**Sample:** 10 random high-impact classifications from 186 total
**Method:** Domain expert assessment of whether "high impact" is correct classification

### Sample 1: Variance Type [X], Impact High
- **Source:** [Section/Title]
- **Target:** [Section/Title] OR [NO MATCH]
- **Reasoning:** [Impact justification from CSV]
- **✅ VALIDATED (Correctly High) / ❌ FAILED (Should be Medium/Low) / ⏸️ UNCERTAIN:** [TO BE COMPLETED]
- **Notes:** [Reviewer assessment of actual impact level]

_[Samples 2-10 follow same format]_

### Test 3 Results Summary
- **Validated (Correct Impact Level):** [X/10]
- **Failed (Incorrect Classification):** [X/10]
- **Uncertain:** [X/10]
- **Accuracy Rate:** [X%]
- **Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS (>70%) / ❌ FAIL (<70%)

---

## Test 4: Edge Case - Low Embedding + High LLM Similarity

**Hypothesis:** LLM semantic understanding catches equivalence that embeddings miss
**Sample:** 5 cases where embedding <0.5 but LLM ≥0.9
**Method:** Verify these are genuinely semantically equivalent despite different wording

### Case 1: Embedding 0.XXX, LLM 0.XX
- **Source:** [Section/Title]
- **Target:** [Section/Title]
- **Why Low Embedding?** [Hypothesis - different wording? different structure?]
- **✅ VALIDATED (LLM Correct) / ❌ FAILED (LLM Wrong) / ⏸️ UNCERTAIN:** [TO BE COMPLETED]
- **Notes:** [Analysis of why embeddings disagreed with LLM]

_[Cases 2-5 follow same format]_

### Test 4 Results Summary
- **Validated (LLM Correct):** [X/5]
- **Failed (Should Not Match):** [X/5]
- **Uncertain:** [X/5]
- **Key Finding:** [Does LLM add value beyond embeddings?]

---

## Test 5: Edge Case - High Embedding + No Match

**Hypothesis:** LLM correctly rejects false positives from embedding similarity
**Sample:** 5 cases where embedding >0.7 but LLM said NO match
**Method:** Verify LLM correctly identified substantive differences

### Case 1: Embedding 0.XXX
- **Source:** [Section/Title]
- **Reasoning for Rejection:** [From CSV]
- **✅ VALIDATED (LLM Correctly Rejected) / ❌ FAILED (Should Have Matched) / ⏸️ UNCERTAIN:** [TO BE COMPLETED]
- **Notes:** [Analysis of what substantive difference LLM caught]

_[Cases 2-5 follow same format]_

### Test 5 Results Summary
- **Validated (Correct Rejection):** [X/5]
- **Failed (Should Have Matched):** [X/5]
- **Uncertain:** [X/5]
- **Key Finding:** [Is LLM catching real differences or being too strict?]
