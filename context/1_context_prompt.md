I am trying to develop an AI solution for comparing 401k Plan Documents (usually pairs of document - so called "Basic Plan Documents" and "Adoption Agreements". Compliance analysts take on such comparisons as part of Cycle 3 Plan Restatements and during Plan Conversions. Ultimately the comparison produce mapping spreadsheets that identify that a provision in a source document maps to a similar provision in target document. These mappings have to include provenance on what page and under what section each side of the mappign is found, and there language has to be found to be similar. Similarity could be exact (meaning despite difference in language, these elections would mean exactly the same thing) to more fuzzy, where there might be notes on the mapping that identify slight to more significant differences in the provisions and what they mean. With this context established I am going to provide some documents as examples: The source document is relius_bpd_cycle3.pdf and relius_aa_cycle3.pdf (the BPD and AA documents respectively on the source side of the mapping). On the target side: ascensus_bpd.pdf and ascensus_aa_profit_sharing.pdf (for the same pair of documents on the target side). I'd like your work to attempt this work with the provided documents perhaps sampling around 10 provisions in the source and whether you find those provisions in the destination. I'm interested in understanding your approach and experiences with the exercise. Some things that are known in advance is that you might not have access to the text (as sometimes the PDFs are vendor locked and don't allow text scanning) and this might result in needing to use your vision capability to see the form and form structure hierarchy to get provenance well documented. And it is also anticipated that any approach which looks a page at a time will have to content with provisions that straddle two pages and could end up fragmented in analysis and require defragmentation. From this POC that you conduct I would like your feedback on what you learned and then your requirements and design ideas for a project to formally take on developing this solution using large language models and potentially cosine similarity approaches to developing a working solution for this problem.
